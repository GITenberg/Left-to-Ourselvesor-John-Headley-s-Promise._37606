<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4><i>THE FIVE.</i></h4>


<img src="images/i007b.png" width="60" height="90" alt="M" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">other,
I'm sure you may trust me!"</p>

<p>"My child, I trust you for all that
you know; but there are things
which no one but a mother can
know."</p>

<p>"Of course there are. Oh, I don't for a moment
mean that I shall do as well as <i>you</i>, mother,
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Headley, thoughtfully,
"you see, Agnes, your dear grandmother in
America is pronounced to be failing very fast. I
have not seen her for twenty years, and if I do
not go now I may never see her again in this
world."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"And father's having to go there on business
now makes it so easy."</p>

<p>"Easy all but leaving you children."</p>

<p>"But I am nineteen now, mother&mdash;quite old
enough to be trusted; besides, grandmama and
aunt Phyllis live next door, and if anything
happened I could run in to them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley smiled, looking half convinced.</p>

<p>"Who is it you are afraid to leave?" asked
Agnes coaxingly. "Is it <i>me</i>, mother?"</p>

<p>"<i>You?</i>" echoed Mrs. Headley, stroking her face
tenderly. "No, not you, dear."</p>

<p>"Then it is John."</p>

<p>"No, no; John is a good boy, he will help you
I am sure."</p>

<p>"Then is it Hugh?"</p>

<p>"No; Hugh is steady, and very fond of his
lessons; and he will be sure to do as you wish him,
if he promises beforehand."</p>

<p>"Then is it Alice?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley shook her head.</p>

<p>"Then it must be Minnie, for there's no one
else. And as to Minnie, you know I love her
exactly as if she were my own child."</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley laughed a little, though bright
tears filled her eyes and fell down into her
lap.</p>

<p>"Don't you think I <i>do</i>?" asked Agnes soberly&mdash;not
half liking the little laugh, or the tears either
for that matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"You love her as much as you possibly can,
dearest, but that does not give you my experience.
No, Agnes, it is not Minnie or any one in particular,
but it is the five of you all together that I'm
afraid to leave. I am so afraid they might get
tired of doing as you said."</p>

<p>"They never have yet, mother. You ask them,
and see."</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley looked thoughtfully into the fire,
and was silent for a long time. So was Agnes,
till at last she roused up suddenly and put her
hand into her mother's.</p>

<p>"There's one Friend I shall always have near,
nearer than next door; always at hand to help
and counsel&mdash;eh, mother dear? We had not
forgotten Him, only we did not say anything
actually about Him."</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, I do not forget; and if I were
more trustful I should not be so afraid."</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley rose and left the room just as the
door opened, and John came in.</p>

<p>"Holloa, Agnes, all alone in the dark," he exclaimed,
stumbling over the stools and chairs.
"Why don't you have a light?"</p>

<p>"Mother and I were talking, and we did not
want any."</p>

<p>"About America? Don't I wish it was me
instead of her, that's all!"</p>

<p>"But, you see, that is not the question," said
Agnes, watching her brother lean back against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12]</a></span>
mantelpiece with nervous eyes. "John, you'll
knock something down."</p>

<p>"Not I. Of course it isn't the question; but
why doesn't mother want to go?"</p>

<p>"She does want to go; only, you see, John, she's
afraid we shall not all get on together."</p>

<p>"Is she afraid we shall quarrel?"</p>

<p>Agnes nodded.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shan't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"But Hugh will?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Hugh and John together," answered Agnes,
smiling too.</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Do you think you <i>will</i>?" asked his sister,
drawing back.</p>

<p>"What a frightened question! Agnes, look here;
I'll promise you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It takes two to make a quarrel, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll promise you to walk out of the room
at the first indication of a squabble. Will that
make things straight?"</p>

<p>"If you will not forget."</p>

<p>"If I do, you look at me, and I'll fly, or be
'mum'!"</p>

<p>"All right, I will," answered Agnes soberly.
"John, I believe mother thinks she ought to go,
and so I am sure we ought to make it easy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[ 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean to."</p>

<p>Agnes kissed him gratefully, but did not speak,
yet John understood, and when she had gone out
of the room he fancied he felt a tear left on his
coat.</p>

<p>He roused himself up, and turned round to
poke the fire into a blaze.</p>

<p>"My eye!" he ejaculated, half audibly, "it will
be a go to do without mother for three months."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<h4><i>A PACKET.</i></h4>

<img src="images/i012b.png"
width="60" height="88" alt="M" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">other,
here is a nice little square
packet come for you by post!" said
Minnie as Mrs. Headley entered the
dining-room the next morning.</p>

<p>"Yes; Minnie has been turning it,
and twisting it, and weighing it, and
smelling it&mdash;doing everything except open it," said
John, laughing.</p>

<p>"I do wish to know what it is though!" said
Minnie shyly, "and I believe John wants to see
just as much as I do."</p>

<p>"I will open it presently," answered their mother,
smiling, while she seated herself at the head of the
table.</p>

<p>"Minnie is always rather curious," observed
Hugh, looking up from a lesson he had been
conning over.</p>

<p>"This is something which will rouse your
curiosity, and I will see who can tell me the
meaning of it," answered Mrs. Headley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you know what it is, mother?" asked
Minnie.</p>

<p>Her mother assented; and when they had finished
breakfast, and their father had gone off to his
business, Mrs. Headley took up the little package
and began untying the knots.</p>

<p>"Cut it," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Catch mother cutting a knot if she can undo
it," laughed Hugh, gathering his books together.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing it is Saturday," said John,
"or we couldn't wait, however curious we might
be."</p>

<p>"There, it is undone!" said Minnie, pressing
nearer. As she spoke the paper fell open, and two
dozen little square books came tumbling out.</p>

<p>The children were going to seize upon them,
when Mrs. Headley placed her hand over them,
taking up one at the same moment, saying.
"What is this, now?"</p>

<p>"A little book," said John.</p>

<p>"Has it reading in it?"</p>

<p>She opened the first page, and to their astonishment
there was nothing but a page of black to be
seen.</p>

<p>"What a strange book!" said Hugh. "It would
not be much trouble to learn a page of <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>"It is a great trouble to learn that black page,
though," said his mother.</p>

<p>Hugh peeped closer. "Let me read the outside,
mother; perhaps it explains."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it does," said his mother, still showing
only the black page.</p>

<p>"Well, what next? as we can't make that out,"
said Alice, who was looking on with her arms
twined round her sister Agnes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley opened the next leaf, and they
found it deep red.</p>

<p>"How strange," said Hugh; "is this difficult to
learn, mother?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley smiled thoughtfully, and answered.
"Not so hard as the other; oh, not half so hard&mdash;for
us!"</p>

<p>"And the next?" said Agnes, with a tender
light in her gentle eyes.</p>

<p>"Pure white!" exclaimed Alice; "and I believe
Agnes guesses."</p>

<p>"What next, mother?" asked Hugh; "for I
suppose you do not mean to tell us the meaning
yet?"</p>

<p>"Gold!" exclaimed Minnie. "How lovely it
looks! Is <i>this</i> difficult to learn, mother?"</p>

<p>"Ah no!" said Mrs. Headley, "that is the
easiest page of all&mdash;nothing but glory."</p>

<p>"<i>Glory?</i>" asked Hugh, "you have told us the
meaning of the last first. Now, what is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"What does the black remind you of, dears?"
she asked, in answer to their eager look.</p>

<p>"Night," "discomfort," "blindness," "being lost,"
suggested several of them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Headley; "but anything else?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it sin, mother?" asked Agnes, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear children, it is sin. The black is
sin; 'hopeless night,' 'discomfort,' 'blindness,'
'being lost'&mdash;all you have said summed up in that
one dark page&mdash;sin."</p>

<p>"Now I guess," exclaimed John hastily, "the
red is Blood. Oh, I guess now!"</p>

<p>"The Blood of Jesus, the Son of God. Nothing
else can take the black sin away. But that <i>can</i>;
yes, the blood is easier to read than the sin, isn't
it, dears?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why," said Hugh, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"Do you not think it is hard to feel that we are
utterly black and sinful, no good in us at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"But turn over the page, and the Blood shuts
out all remembrance of the sin. The Lamb of
God, who taketh away the sin of the world."</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" said Agnes.</p>

<p>Their mother turned to the next page, and
went on.</p>

<p>"Then, when the Blood has cleansed us, what
are we?"</p>

<p>"Whiter than snow," said Minnie reverently.</p>

<p>"That is right, little Minnie; and I think the
white reminds us of two or three things. Can you
suggest them, children?"</p>

<p>"How pure we ought to be?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes, and how pure He is," answered her mother.</p>

<p>"'These are they that have washed their robes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[ 18]</a></span>
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,'"
said Alice. "That was our text last Sunday."</p>

<p>"So it was, and the end of it introduces us to
our final page, and that lasts for ever."</p>

<p>"Gold," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Glory," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Everlasting glory, all joy and light for evermore.
All purchased for us by that one page
which cost Him His life's blood. Now, dear children,
repeat over to me the lessons of this little
book, that we may all remember them together&mdash;</p>

<p class="altfont">Black&mdash;Red&mdash;White&mdash;Gold.</p>

<p>The childrena repeated the words as their mother
turned the pages, and then she added:</p>

<p class="altfont">Sin&mdash;Blood&mdash;Righteousness&mdash;Glory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley then passed a book to each of
them, saying in a low tone, with an earnestness
which impressed her young hearers, "May all of
you fly from the first, take refuge in the second, be
covered by the third, and share the last."</p>

<p>When their mother had left them Minnie stood
looking long and lovingly at her little treasure, as
if she would read its wordless leaves if she could.</p>

<p>"I think this book has a whole story on each
page," said Agnes thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I wish you could tell us one," answered Minnie,
looking up wistfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will next Sunday," replied Agnes.</p>

promised to tell us a story of the
'Wordless pages,' Agnes," said Minnie
on Sunday afternoon, when the children
had left their parents to a few moments'
quiet, and were gathered in the drawing-room
to spend the hour in which Agnes
generally read to them.</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten," answered Agnes, "but,
as mother said, the first page is very hard to read,
and the second page&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" said John.</p>

<p>"You will see," answered Agnes. "Come on
my lap, Minnie; you will not be afraid if I describe
something very dreadful?"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>think</i> so," said Minnie wondering; "but
is it dreadful, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think that first page looks dreadful?
So black and hopeless!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so it does."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then listen:</p>

<p class="altfont">Black&mdash;Sin.</p>

<p>I seemed to be dreaming, and in my dream I
beheld a rocky country stretched out before me.</p>

<p>On all sides were rugged stones, underneath
which grew ferns and mosses, while short brushwood,
growing luxuriantly, gave the place a wild,
unfrequented appearance.</p>

<p>By-and-by I heard the sound of voices approaching,
and two boys came in view, who seemed to be
travelling through this mountainous country.</p>

<p>They were jumping lightly from stone to stone, or
pushing their way through the bushes in the more
open parts, talking gaily as they came towards
me."</p>

<p>"I have heard that there are some wonderful
caverns somewhere about here, and I have determined
to try and find them out," said one.</p>

<p>"The Guide-book says they are most perilous,"
answered the other, opening his knapsack and
looking in a book he carried there.</p>

<p>"Oh, those old Guide-books always call everything
dangerous," answered the other contemptuously,
"and I am not going to be turned from my
purpose by any such nonsense. Look here!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he too opened his knapsack, and
proceeded to pull out two candles triumphantly.</p>

<p>"With these we shall do perfectly well," he
added, laughing, "and shall prove the Guide-book
to have been written for people with less sense."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to see the caverns," said the
younger boy hesitatingly, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No 'buts' for me," sneered the other, jumping
up; "I am off to explore the mysteries. It is
because you are afraid, I believe."</p>

<p>I thought that the younger boy seemed not to
like being called afraid, for he got up reluctantly
and followed his companion somewhat slowly; not
at all as he had bounded over the rocks a few
minutes before.</p>

<p>A call from the other announced that he had
discovered the opening, and the colour flushed
into the younger boy's face as he hastened on.</p>

<p>In my dream I seemed permitted to follow
them unseen, and saw before me the mouth of the
caverns, large and wide.</p>

<p>The boys laughed gaily, but I was not sure
if I were right in imagining an uneasiness in their
merriment.</p>

<p>They eagerly traversed the outer caves, which
were quite light, and chose one of the many
winding turnings.</p>

<p>"You will want your candle soon, Edred," said
the younger.</p>

<p>"So I shall, and I mean to have it too, and see
all the beauties of which I have heard."</p>

<p>They stopped to light the tapers, and I could
not help wondering whether they would last long
enough to guide them safely out again; but as I
knew nothing of these dangerous caves, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22]</a></span>
only follow silently, with an anxiety which increased
as I perceived how headstrong Edred
appeared to be.</p>

<p>They wandered on and on, the light from their
tapers illuminating the wonderful caverns, and the
boys were full of interest and enjoyment, while
my eyes watched the quickly-lessening candles.</p>

<p>"You told me the Guide-book spoke of evil
beasts," said Edred mockingly, "but I don't see a
sign of them, and this place is like a fairy palace."</p>

<p>"I wish we were going out towards the light,"
said Alwin; "we have been going inwards so long,
and I am sure we shall lose our way, there are
such numbers of turnings."</p>

<p>"No fear," answered the other, "I can tell which
way we are going; you have not a grain of sense.
Alwin!"</p>

<p>Alwin sighed, "I'm afraid I am stupid, but I
did hear a noise just now, and I have seen several
shadows that I can't account for."</p>

<p>Did Edred look round nervously, or was it my
fancy? The lights burned lower still, but the boys
were too intent to notice.</p>

<p>"I am tired," said Alwin, "let us rest."</p>

<p>Edred glanced at him, and seemed to consider.
"Well," he said, "I dare say we shall reach the
end the sooner for a little rest; and I want to look
right down the abyss which they say is to be found
there; so let us sit down here."</p>

<p>Alwin willingly consented, but he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23]</a></span>
started from his seat again. "They say," he exclaimed,
"that there is a mysterious drowsiness
which creeps over people in this cavern. Can we
be falling into that, think you?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," answered Edred, "this is only
ordinary fatigue, five minutes' sleep will revive us,
and we shall be as fresh as ever."</p>

<p>Already they had set down their candles near
them; and as they leaned back against the rocky
sides of the cavern a strain of music, soft and
dreamy, filled the air, and they slept.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Long I watched, and would willingly have
waked them, but that I found myself spell-bound.
I was unable to speak or move. I could only look;
and as I looked, the weird, dreamy music continued
to lull them into deeper slumber, while their little
lights burned lower and lower, and then slowly
flickered out, and they were left in dense darkness.</p>

<p>Then the music seemed to change into a new
key, and my fancy made me think it sounded like
the distant cries of some in dire distress. The
miserable moan seemed to disturb the sleepers, for
I heard an exclamation of dismay, and Alwin's
voice said, in a tone of horror, "Edred! Edred!
where are we? our lights are gone out!" Edred
seemed to be only half awake, and he grumbled
an impatient answer; but Alwin shook him with a
despairing cry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?" said Edred, now thoroughly
roused.</p>

<p>"We are in darkness; we shall never find our
way out. Oh, what shall we do, Edred?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, I am sure," said Edred; "but
we had better turn the way we came."</p>

<p>"But which way?" said the other.</p>

<p>"This, to be sure," said Edred, beginning to
grope his way along.</p>

<p>"But there were numbers of turnings, Edred,"
said Alwin reproachfully; "and the Guide-book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop that!" called Edred, with fierce anger,
"we shall come all right; but let's have a truce to
your whining."</p>

<p>Alwin was silent after this rebuke; but the
caverns were by no means silent, for now the
unearthly sounds seemed to increase, and the boys
clung to each other in terror. Louder and louder
grew the roar, and I heard one of them exclaim.
"There is something coming towards us. Oh, see!
what is it? what can it be?"</p>

<p>The anguish of those words I shall never forget.</p>

<p>Before them along one of the many passages,
a faint light seemed to shine; it came apparently
from the eyes of a fierce beast who was approaching.
The light was not sufficient to discern his
shape, but from the lurid glare cast upwards from
his eyes I could see three letters traced on his brow&mdash;S-I-N.
They were incomprehensible to me, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25]</a></span>
I think the boys understood them; for, as they
confronted those mysterious letters, they fell back
appalled. Well indeed they might, for such a
dreadful creature as bore them I never before
beheld. He approached nearer and nearer, while
the boys shrank back against the rocks. The fiend
looked as if he would devour them; but yet, as he
came near, I perceived his intention was to torture
them for a while first. He came close up to them,
and seemed almost to enfold them in his embrace.
He whispered to them, and as his eyes cast a light
on their faces, I could see the misery and despair
depicted there. The fiend then gave a growl of
awful meaning, and set himself down at a little
distance from them, as if to take some sleep.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" whispered Alwin mournfully.</p>

<p>"That he would <i>never</i> let us go," answered
Edred in a despairing tone.</p>

<p>"Let us try to get away," again whispered
Alwin; "will no one save us?"</p>

<p>"No one is so strong as he," said Edred hoarsely.
"What fools we were, Alwin!"</p>

<p>"What shall we do? Do let us try to escape."</p>

<p>They crept forward a few steps, but the ground
was noisome mire after the passage of this creature,
and the boys were covered with filth at every step
they took.</p>

<p>It was all in vain, however, for they knew not
which way to go; and once, when a slight sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26]</a></span>
roused the attention of the fierce fiend, he turned
as if to spring on them, uttering a deep growl.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" again whispered Alwin.</p>

<p>"That it is of no use our trying to escape,"
groaned Edred. "He says there is no return from
this pit of darkness."</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Then I awoke from my dream.</p>

<p>Agnes paused, and the children remained silent,
till Minnie broke forth with passionate earnestness&mdash;</p>

<p>"But oh, Agnes, there <i>is</i> a way out! Oh, why
were they left there to perish?"</p>

<p>"That was all I saw in that dream," said Agnes;
"and when I woke these words were ringing in
my ears, 'The wages of sin is death.'"</p>

<p>"But," said John, with kindling eyes, "there is a
bit more to the end of that verse, Agnes."</p>

<p>"Not if we keep only to the first page of the
'Wordless Book,'" answered Agnes.</p>

<p>"But we need not keep to the first page, need
we?" said Minnie, looking rather sorrowful.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank God! For Hugh shall finish
that twenty-third verse of the sixth of Romans
which begins so sadly."</p>

<p>So Hugh repeated: "'The wages of sin is
death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><i>RESCUED: AN ALLEGORY.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i025b.png"
width="50" height="116" alt="A" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">nother
Sunday came round, and the
brothers and sisters again claimed Agnes's
promise to continue the story of the
"Wordless" pages. They had several
times in the week asked if she could do
so then; but she had always answered.
"Wait till Sunday."</p>

<p>"Now Agnes," said John, "let us have the rest
of that dream."</p>

<p>"I did describe to you all that dream," answered
Agnes. "What I have to tell you to-day is
another dream&mdash;a new page as it were; not black,
but red."</p>

<p>"I thought it was to be a continuation," said
Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is; but you will not let me begin."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes we will," said Minnie. "Now then.
Agnes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="altfont">Red&mdash;Blood.</p>

<p>Again I dreamed, and found myself in the
same cavern where I had before been such a
terrified spectator. Should I be able to see the
dismal end of those miserable boys? I asked
myself. At first the darkness seemed impenetrable,
and as there was no sound to break the stillness, I
feared that already the fierce beast had devoured
those whom he had captured.</p>

<p>But hark! was not that a sobbing sigh from
some one?</p>

<p>Again it met my ear, and I thought I could
distinguish Alwin's voice, saying in a low, pleading
tone:</p>

<p>"Edred, I am sure I read something in the
Guide-book about the King's Son, who lives in that
Palace we saw over the Hills there, being willing
to rescue travellers, if they were in distress."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Edred, in a frightened voice,
"the fiend will hear you, and will spring upon us
if he thinks we are meditating escape&mdash;however
futile it may be," he added bitterly.</p>

<p>"He is half asleep over there," answered Alwin
in a low tone; "see how he rests, and his eyes are
shut. Oh, Edred, our position is so dreadful that
it is worth a desperate effort to get free."</p>

<p>"No effort is of any avail," said Edred hopelessly.
"If you only look at yonder monster, with
his awful name shining on his forehead, you will
know that he will never let us enter the King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29]</a></span>
Palace; he told us just now that his wages are
death, and that we shall <i>not</i> escape."</p>

<p>"I know," said Alwin, "but all the same I
have read enough of the Guide-book to believe
there is some way of deliverance; do, Edred, try
to recall what it was."</p>

<p>"I never read it," said Edred, "and to consult
it now, when we are in this dire distress, seems like
mocking the King who ordered it to be written."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and as I grew accustomed
to the darkness, I could faintly perceive the two
boys crouching down in a corner, watching the
evil beast, never taking their wearied eyes from
him for a moment.</p>

<p>Alwin seemed unable to let go his last hope, and
began again imploringly, "Edred, I <i>know</i> it said if
people got into these caverns they were to call to
the King; do let us try."</p>

<p>"Call and wake the monster?" asked Edred,
mockingly. "Besides, who could hear?"</p>

<p>"I shall try," whispered Alwin, "for I feel I
shall soon have no strength left."</p>

<p>Edred made a gesture as if to reply, when the
enemy roused himself suddenly, and before either
of them had time to speak or move, he had sprung
across the cavern. I saw the two boys disappear
beneath his awful form.</p>

<p>A fearful cry rent the air, a cry of agony, but a
cry too which seemed to expect an answer.</p>

<p>The fiend grappled with them both, and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30]</a></span>
them blow after blow. Still spell-bound I watched,
feeling myself turned to stone with horror.</p>

<p>But what did I hear? Surely above the cruel
strokes which resounded on the bodies of these
captive boys, surely above their cries for help, and
moans of anguish, I heard another sound&mdash;a sound
of rescue, coming nearer and nearer?</p>

<p>Did the evil creature hear it too? Did he not
strike the faster, that there might be no deliverance;
that the deliverance might be too late?</p>

<p>A strange light approached along one of the
passages, and all at once One entered the cavern,
and dealt a swift blow at the fiend, which made
him relax his hold, only to tighten it more painfully.
"I have come to deliver those that are appointed
to die," said a voice of heavenly sweetness; but
the fiend turned on Him with blows, fiercer and
deadlier than those he had given the boys, and
there ensued such a terrible combat that my very
heart failed me.</p>

<p>By-and-by I found that the fiend seemed to
grow weaker and weaker, and the Deliverer, though
wounded and bleeding, was a Conqueror. The
evil creature at last sank down in the mire, motionless,
his grasp loosened from the poor boys, and
the Conqueror came up to them and raised them
from the ground.</p>

<p>Alwin had just sufficient strength left to clasp
the feet of his Deliverer with a cry of love, but
Edred neither spoke nor moved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Edred," said the tender voice, "I have fought,
and he who held thee is conquered; wilt thou
come with Me?"</p>

<p>Edred groaned.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not stay here, Edred?" again said
the loving tone reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I am not worthy," moaned Edred, "I disobeyed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, thou art not worthy; but I have
loved thee, and have done it all for thee. Edred,
wilt thou refuse?"</p>

<p>Then I heard a broken cry of grateful acquiescence,
and the two lost, hopeless boys were clasped
to that bosom of love.</p>

<p>And Alwin whispered, "Thou hast been wounded
in the sore fight, for I can feel Thy blood flowing
upon me!"</p>

<p>"That was the price at which I rescued thee,"
answered the Deliverer, "and thou shalt find when
we come into the Light that the Blood of the
King's Son worketh marvels for thee."</p>

<p>"Art Thou the King's Son?" asked Edred as
they moved forward from this cavern of Death.</p>

<p>"Didst thou not know?" answered his Deliverer
with a radiant smile, "no one else is 'Mighty to
save.'"</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>When Agnes ceased the relation of her dream,
she turned over the leaves of her Bible which lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32]</a></span>
on her knee, her brothers and sisters waiting to see
if there were any more of the story.</p>

<p>At last she looked up, and said earnestly, "You
all like allegories, but they can only teach one side
of a truth at once, and the Lord Jesus has done
so much more than anything I can say for us. I
have not told you half that Red page means, but
you can seek it out for yourselves, dears. Think of
all the love which brought Him down to redeem
us, and what it cost Him, and let the Red page of
the 'Wordless Book' impress this upon your hearts,
never to be forgotten, 'Without shedding of blood
is no remission;' 'God commendeth His love
toward us, in that, while we were yet <i>sinners</i>.
Christ died for us.'"</p>

<h3><i>NEW ROBES: AN ALLEGORY.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i031b.png"
width="59" height="120" alt="H" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">ave
you another dream to tell us?"
asked Minnie on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>"It is the end of the same dream,
but it has a different page in the 'Wordless
Book' as its suggestion," answered
Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes, the White page," said John.</p>

<p class="altfont">White&mdash;Righteousness.</p>

<p>Then the boys passed out towards the Light,
leaning on Him who had delivered them. I
followed silently, still allowed to watch and listen.</p>

<p>"Dost Thou say that Thou wilt present us to
the King?" asked Alwin hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Their Deliverer assented; for Edred immediately
answered, "We are not fit to appear before Him!
Thy power has indeed saved us from the destruction
we merited; but we are so soiled and filthy from
contact with the mire in this awful Cavern, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34]</a></span>
could not appear before any one, least of all before
the Great King." He spoke eagerly and half
proudly.</p>

<p>"Dost thou not remember what I told thee?
That My Blood, which has been shed for thee, with
which thou hast been covered, will work&mdash;nay, has
already worked, marvels; and when the Light
shines upon thee, thou wilt see. Fear nothing,
only believe what I tell thee."</p>

<p>They were silent after this, and were quickly
approaching the end of the darkness. Then the
boys could look upon their Deliverer, and could
see the terrible wounds that He had sustained in
His conflict with the foul fiend. And when they
looked they wept&mdash;wept for sorrow that He
should so have suffered for them&mdash;wept for joy
that they were safe from the dreadful destruction.</p>

<p>They thought not of themselves; but when I
could unfasten my eyes from the lovely face of the
Deliverer, I was amazed to find that the boys were
no longer arrayed in their former clothes, for in
that mysterious passage from Darkness to Light
all these had been changed, and they were now
clad in a spotless robe of pure white.</p>

<p>By-and-by they perceived it themselves, or
rather their Guide pointed it out to them.</p>

<p>"See," He said tenderly, "what My deliverance
has done for you; now you can meet the King
without fear. Covered by this robe, you will be
accepted even in His eyes, because when He sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35]</a></span>
it He will remember that I have fought for you
and prevailed; and He will count My merits
yours."</p>

<p>He led them now swiftly, it seemed to me,
towards a spot which He told them would be the
Meeting-place, but for the first time I was unable
to follow them. A thin cloud seemed to obscure
my vision for a while.</p>

<p>When I saw the boys again their Guide had
left them, and they were walking along the road
towards the Palace of the King, which lay at the
end of the journey.</p>

<p>They were busily engaged in perusing the
Guide-book, which Edred had before so despised;
but now his face bent over it with a look which
was both inquiring and trustful.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Alwin, when it says,
'Needeth not save to wash his feet?'"</p>

<p>"Does it not mean that we, who have been
cleansed from all that filth by the wonderful
efficacy of our Deliverer's Blood, still may get
defilements in our path, and that these will need
constant washing away?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it does," said Edred hesitatingly and
looking round; "but where&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Our Deliverer told us&mdash;do you not remember
it?&mdash;that by our road we should find a cleansing
stream, dyed by His Blood, to which we must
needs constantly repair."</p>

<p>"He did, but I had well-nigh forgotten it; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36]</a></span>
see, Alwin, the end of the journey is not so very
far off; just beyond those Hills, where the radiance
is; there will be nothing to defile us <i>there</i>."</p>

<p>Alwin looked towards the Hills in silence, with
a rapt face, on which the glory seemed reflected.
Then he added suddenly, "Our Deliverer said that
He might fetch us Himself, instead of our travelling
so far; that would be better still, Edred."</p>

<p>"Indeed it would," answered Edred earnestly.
"I hope He will."</p>

<p>Then I awoke from my dream.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"And this text has been running in my head
while I have been pondering over my dream,"
added Agnes, "'The blood of Jesus Christ His
Son cleanseth us from all sin'&mdash;and&mdash;'He hath
made us accepted in the Beloved.'"</p>

hands together as she seated herself in
the bow-window seat on the Sunday
before their parents were to sail for
America.</p>

<p>"<i>Sorry!</i>" echoed Minnie, "why, I am very glad

<p>"Because it is the last, I mean," answered Alice;
"we shall miss our Sunday afternoon story dreadfully."</p>

<p>"I propose that Agnes tells us one every

<p>Agnes shook her head, but answered, half-smiling.
"Sometimes, perhaps, I may, but you
know they cannot be all allegories."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Hugh; "but let us begin our
last page now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38]</a></span></p>

<p class="altfont">Gold&mdash;Glory.</p>

<p>Once again I dreamed, and once again I saw
the boys in whom I took so much interest.</p>

<p>This time they were nearing the Hills, above
which the radiance shone.</p>

<p>The country was still of the same mountainous
description, and I thought I could see beneath
the steep ascent before me a River winding in and
out.</p>

<p>The golden light seemed to shine down on
some parts of the River, but generally it was dark
and sombre.</p>

<p>Just now the boys were standing near it, and
Edred was gazing down into its depths.</p>

<p>"It is rather dreadful, Alwin," he exclaimed,
turning round and glancing in his companion's
face, "to think of having to cross this before we
reach the Palace of the King."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Alwin, "and when we look
down into it, instead of looking up at the Glory,
we do get depressed. But, you know, Edred, our
Deliverer has promised to bear us safely through."</p>

<p>"Of course He has. He would not leave those
whom He has delivered at such a price to perish
in the final water, Alwin. No; I will not look
down into the River any longer, but rather, as you
say, to the Glory beyond. But I wish I knew
more of its delights."</p>

<p>"The Guide-book tells us a great deal about it;
and often since we have neared this River, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39]</a></span>
had to turn to the description of it to cheer my
fainting courage."</p>

<p>"I wish I were acquainted with the Guide-book
as you are, Alwin; but I do love it much more
than I used&mdash;I love it dearly! What does it
say?"</p>

<p>"Shall I read it to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do," answered Edred, throwing himself
down on the grass by the side of the water, and
settling himself into an attitude of expectancy.</p>

<p>Alwin once more drew from his knapsack the
Guide-book, which had seen much service since
my eyes had first fallen upon it, and with one
glance upwards at the radiance over the Hills, he
turned towards his companion and read in a
thrilling tone from the book in his hand, words
which seemed familiar to me, though I could not
tell in my dream where I heard them:</p>

<p>"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth:
for the first heaven and the first earth were
passed away; and there was no more sea.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
pain: for the former things are passed away.
Then came unto me one of the seven angels...,
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and
high mountain, and showed me that great city,
the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven
from God, having the glory of God: and her light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40]</a></span>
was like unto a stone most precious, even like a
jasper stone, clear as crystal. And I saw no
temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and
the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had
no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine
in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the
Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations of
them which are saved shall walk in the light of it:
and the kings of the earth do bring their glory
and honour into it. And the gates of it shall not
be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night
there. And they shall bring the glory and the
honour of the nations into it. And there shall in
no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither
whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie:
but they which are written in the Lamb's book of
life. And there shall be no more curse: but the
throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it;
and His servants shall serve Him: and they shall
see His face; and His name shall be in their
foreheads. And there shall be no night there;
and they need no candle, neither light of the sun;
for the Lord God giveth them light: and they
shall reign for ever and ever."</p>

<p>Alwin ceased reading, and Edred, whose eyes,
from being turned on his friend's face at first, had
been latterly directed upwards, now rose from the
ground with a new light shining in them.</p>

<p>"Alwin," he said solemnly, "I always have
dreaded this River, but I do not any longer. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[ 41]</a></span>
have long known that I should soon have to pass
through it. Ever since we were in that Cavern of
Death I have known it, but now I fear it no longer.
The words of the Guide-book have taken away my
terror. See, I shall soon be where the light will
never fade away."</p>

<p>As he spoke a touch of golden light which had
for a moment illumined the dark river passed away
from it, and the gloom grew deeper.</p>

<p>But Edred thought not of it, his eyes were
fixed on the Light beyond.</p>

<p>"You are not going to leave me alone?" said
the younger boy yearningly.</p>

<p>"I must; I have been sent for by the King.
He told me some little time ago that it would be
soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edred!" murmured Alwin.</p>

<p>"He will bear you through too," answered Edred
kindly. "I could not have believed that His words
would have cheered me so. I am quite joyful in
going now. I only long to cross."</p>

<p>As he spoke he stepped into the River, which
looked to me so dark and drear.</p>

<p>Now a mist brooded over the River, between
those standing on the bank and the Shore beyond,
and so Edred was lost to my sight.</p>

<p>Alwin stood long looking after him, with tear-dimmed
eyes; but by-and-by he turned once more
to the Book in his hand, and as he read it I
noticed that the sorrow passed away from his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little while," he murmured to himself, and
turned to go on his journey.</p>

<p>But I saw that his road lay close to the River;
and, or ever I was aware, I found he too had
entered the water, and was actually crossing over
to the bright Land.</p>

<p>As the waters got deeper and deeper, his face
only grew the more radiant, and when the mist
almost hid him from my view, I heard a triumphant
voice exclaiming, "Thanks be unto God for His
unspeakable Gift."</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Minnie's little head was laid on Agnes's lap
during the narration of this dream, and she now
raised it with an earnest look.</p>

<p>"And that is <i>all</i>?" she said, sighing.</p>

<p>"All, except that there is no <i>end</i> to the Glory,"
replied Agnes.</p>

<p>"No," said John, "I often think that is the best
of Heaven&mdash;there will be no 'leaving-off' there."</p>

<p>"That is just it," answered Agnes, "and the
summing-up of all these Wordless
pages&mdash;of Sin&mdash;Blood&mdash;Righteousness&mdash;Glory&mdash;seems
to me to be
expressed in these words, 'That ye might walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.... Who
hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance
of the saints in light.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><i>LAST DAYS.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i041b.png"
width="51" height="117" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">sn't
it awfully cold for you and mother
to travel at this time of year, father?"
asked Hugh as he buttoned up his warm
great coat to set out for school for the last
time before the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>"Very; but you see, my boy, urgent
business calls me; and urgent necessity calls your
mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! but I wish it were summer. Are you
really going on Saturday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God willing."</p>

<p>Hugh went into the hall, where he found his
brother brushing his hat.</p>

<p>"I wonder why father always adds 'God willing,'"
he said in an undertone, "so few people do. Do
you care about it, John?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say that I've come to doing it
myself," answered John candidly; "but I do feel
this, Hugh, that when they're out on the Atlantic
I'd rather know they had <i>felt</i> it was 'God willing,'
than that they should have acted on their own
responsibility."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh whistled. "You ain't getting preachified I
suppose, are you, John?"</p>

<p>"No; but, all the same, I know when I think a
thing's right."</p>

<p>"So do I; leastways I know when I'm in the
right, and that's generally!"</p>

<p>"Or you think so."</p>

<p>"Of course; comes to the same thing."</p>

<p>Hugh had a pleasantly good opinion of himself,
which often roused the ridicule and annoyance of
his brother and sisters; and so before John was
aware he found himself caught in an argument
which was beginning to rasp his temper.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off," he said, abruptly turning on his
heel, thinking within himself that if his promise to
Agnes was to be kept during his parents' absence
it would be well to begin at once.</p>

<p>"Beaten off the field?" asked Hugh, laughing,
while he turned round to give his mother a passing
kiss.</p>

<p>"Teasing again, my boy," she said gently.</p>

<p>"Only on the surface, mother," he answered
lightly.</p>

<p>"Do you not think that the surface of a mirror
sometimes gets scratched, and cannot reflect back
the same perfect image it should?"</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. "Mother, I shall be late,"
he said, turning the handle of the door, and wishing
to escape.</p>

<p>She smiled archly. "Next week there will be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45]</a></span>
mother to run away from, so listen, Hugh. Can't
you invent some remedy for that tongue of yours?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't doing a bit of harm, mother, then."</p>

<p>"But if you <i>could</i> you would be 'able to bridle
the whole body.' Think of that, Hugh! Can you
not make up your mind to try?"</p>

<p>"All right, mother, I'll see about it."</p>

<p>"Not in your own strength though, dear."</p>

<p>He nodded, and seeing that he was let off, he
darted through the door and was gone in a moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley turned back with a momentary
look of pain, then, as if those words were whispered
in her ear she heard:</p>

<p>"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening
withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not
whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether
they both shall be alike <i>good</i>." And at that word
she went into the dining-room with a smile on
her face, and seated herself at her preparations
with peace in her heart.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for poor people this
Christmas, mother?" said Minnie, throwing her
arms round her mother's neck in her warm-hearted
little way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley looked up from the close embrace
with a smile, and answered, "We shall not be able
to do very much this year, Minnie; but I have not
forgotten."</p>

<p>"I did not think you had, only I do like to know."</p>

<p>At this moment Agnes entered the room, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46]</a></span>
in her arms a heap of garments, which she deposited
on the table, saying to her mother, "This
is all I can find, and they will need a good many
stitches."</p>

<p>"I dare say they will," said Mrs. Headley; "but
we must all help."</p>

<p>Minnie peered curiously at the assortment of
clothes, and exclaimed, "Why, there's my old
frock, Agnes! Whatever are you going to do with
that?"</p>

<p>"This is part of what we are going to do for
Christmas," said her mother.</p>

<p>Minnie looked incredulous, and turned over her
brother's worn jacket with the tips of her rosy
fingers rather disdainfully.</p>

<p>Agnes already had seated herself at the table,
and was proceeding to examine each garment with
critical eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley glanced at the little face opposite
her, but made no remark as she leaned over to
reach the old dress, which Minnie thought so
useless.</p>

<p>"This wants a button, Minnie; get the box, and
see if there is one like the others there."</p>

<p>Minnie sprang up to get it, and was soon engaged
in searching for the button. "What's it for?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Some little girl who has a worse one than this."</p>

<p>"Are there any? I thought this was so very
shabby."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plenty, I am sorry to think; but if we get this
ready for some one, there will be one less needing
a frock."</p>

<p>"Why is Agnes helping?" asked Minnie, drawing
nearer.</p>

<p>"Because she wants to do something to make
Christmas happy to others."</p>

<p>"Will this make any one happy?" asked Minnie
again, her puzzled little face gradually assuming a
more contented look.</p>

<p>"Should you not think so, if you had a little
bare frock just drawn together with a crooked pin,
and hardly covering your shivering little shoulders?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed," said Minnie, now quite convinced,
eyeing her warm though cast-off frock with
fresh interest. "Could I do anything to help make
it ready?"</p>

<p>"You can put on the button, and fasten this
little bit of hem."</p>

<p>"Why do you mend all these things? Could
not their mothers do it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley did not answer, so Minnie sat
down; and while she put on the button she
pondered the question.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Headley with rapid fingers was
darning and patching, aided by Agnes, who sat
industriously stitching away, silently buried in her
own thoughts.</p>

<p>At last Minnie exclaimed, "Is this all you are
going to do, mother?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, my dear, we are making some puddings
for three or four families."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course! I knew you would; I do
love Christmas."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Minnie knows or thinks about why
we do it?"</p>

<p>"Because we love the Lord Jesus, I suppose,"
answered Minnie, looking up from her work with
her tender little face.</p>

<p>"Not only that, dear, though that is one reason.
Do you remember what we were reading the other
day about dealing our bread to the hungry?"</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"And about visiting 'the fatherless and widows
in their affliction'?" added Agnes.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! but, then, <i>this</i> isn't visiting the fatherless
and widows; this is making things at home."</p>

<p>"Should you like to help me take them when
they are done, Minnie?" asked Agnes, looking up.</p>

<p>"That I should, if I might."</p>

<p>"You may, then," said her mother; "and I
think you will understand their value better after
you have been."</p>

<p>Just then John and Hugh came in from school,
and guessing what their mother and sisters were
engaged in, they suddenly disappeared; at which
Mrs. Headley did not look surprised, nor did she
either when they re-entered with her rag-bag, a
large cardboard box, and a small parcel.</p>

<p>Minnie threw down her work and jumped up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49]</a></span>
examine this new marvel; but John, who liked to
tease her, kept his intentions to himself, and taking
a pair of scissors, bent down his head into the box,
and was soon absorbed.</p>

<p>Hugh, who was less particular, opened the
parcel, and drew out a piece of bright-patterned
<i>cretonne</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed his little sister,
leaning over the table. "What are you going to
do, Hugh?"</p>

<p>Agnes glanced up, and reminded Minnie of her
own work; but she was too busy in conjecturing
what Hugh was about to heed.</p>

<p>He laid the piece out on the table, folded it in
half, and proceeded to thread himself a needle.</p>

<p>"Are you going to <i>work</i>, Hugh?" asked the
never-satisfied little maiden.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded, nowise disconcerted at her surprised
tone, and soon he had begun to sew up the
sides, clumsily enough perhaps, but still effectually.</p>

<p>Minnie found work was to be "the order of the
day," so she relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>After an hour's close application, during which
time Minnie had watched with curious eyes John's
hand diving in and out of the rag-bag, Hugh
pronounced his contribution done, and went over
to his brother and asked him if his were ready.
A whispered consultation ensued behind the
cardboard box, and then there was some mysterious
pushing and man[oe]uvring, which raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50]</a></span>
Minnie's expectation to the last extent. Her
brothers, however, enjoyed keeping up the joke,
and there was a fine laugh when they laid a
neatly-finished cushion on the table in front of the
inquisitive little girl.</p>

<p>"What is in it?" she asked, pinching and pulling
it about.</p>

<p>"Only mother's woollen rags snipped up in tiny
pieces," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"You should not have told her," remarked John;
"but I say, don't my fingers ache! and isn't there
a blister on my thumb?"</p>

<p>"Did you cut all that to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, we have been at the snipping business all
the week, off and on, and I declare old Mrs. Hales
will not have a bad pillow after all."</p>

<p>"Where is Alice?" said Hugh.</p>

<p>"She is doing her part," answered Mrs. Headley;
"this is a busy time for cook, and Alice is helping
her to make the puddings."</p>

<p>"When shall we go round, Agnes?" asked
Minnie.</p>

<p>"On Christmas Eve, mother thinks."</p>

<p>"I wish it were here, then."</p>

<p>"I do not, for we must finish all this heap of
mending first."</p>

<p>"You'll tell us who you give it to, Agnes, and
all about your visits," said John, who loved a story
as much as anyone. "It will make us 'good boys'
when they are gone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Agnes.</p>

<p>"Then we will wait patiently till then; and if
you can think of anything we can help in, we are
ready, mother, now it is holiday time."</p>

<p>"I will consider it," she answered, "but while
we plan to do something for those in need, let us
remember, my dears, one thing."</p>

<p>The faces were turned affectionately towards
the mother, who so anxiously watched over her
children, while she said gently, "It is not <i>only</i> that
we are to 'visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction,' but we are 'to keep ourselves unspotted
from the world.'"</p>

<p>"That's almost harder than the other," said
Hugh thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Except by 'looking off unto Jesus,'" said Mrs.
Headley; "'I can do all things, through Christ
which strengtheneth me.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><i>ONE INJUNCTION.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i050b.png"
width="47" height="113" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap"> cannot
leave you a great number of
injunctions," exclaimed Mrs. Headley
tearfully, on that last morning when all
was ready for departure, and the day for
the sailing of the steamer had really
come.</p>

<p>"I think you have, mother," said Hugh, trying
to hide his feeling under a joke.</p>

<p>"No, not to you, dear; to Agnes I may
have."</p>

<p>"Yes, to <i>me</i>" said Hugh. "I am to mind Agnes,
and not to mind John; and to mind I am kind to
Minnie; and to keep in mind that Alice is younger
than I; and to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said John; "we don't want to hear
your gabble to the last moment!"</p>

<p>"I was going to say," resumed their mother
gently, "that there was one thing I did want you
to think of."</p>

<p>"Tell us then, mother," said Alice, putting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53]</a></span>
arm round her fondly, "we'll keep it as the most
important of all."</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence, and then Mrs.
Headley turned to her husband with a mute appeal.
"Tell them," she said brokenly, "what we were
saying this morning."</p>

<p>"We want you all to think of one thing. In <i>any</i>
difficulty, in <i>every</i> difficulty, in <i>all</i> circumstances,
say to yourselves, 'Lord, what wilt Thou have me
to do?' If you wait and hear the answer, it will
help you in everything."</p>

<p>"People generally do wait to hear the answer to
their question, don't they, father?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Not always; especially when they are speaking
to God. But you be wiser, my children. In the
waiting-time for the answer an extra blessing often
comes."</p>

<p>The children looked thoughtful; and then their
father took from a paper a large painted card in an
oak frame, which he proceeded to hang up on a
nail ready prepared for it.</p>

<p>On the card were letters in crimson and gold
and blue, and the children read:</p>

<p class="altfont">"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"</p>

<p>Then the sound of wheels suddenly reminded
them that the parting had come. With a close
embrace to each from their mother, and with an
earnest "God bless you" to each from their father,
the travellers turned to the door, followed by John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54]</a></span>
and Hugh, who were to accompany them to the
railway station.</p>

<p>When the last bit of the cab had disappeared.
Agnes turned round to her younger sisters and put
her arms round them both lovingly. "We'll be
ever so happy together when we once get settled
in," she said, choking down her own emotion, and
bending down to kiss them in turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Alice with a sob, trying to
look up bravely.</p>

<p>But Minnie could not look up. Her mother
was her all, and her mother had gone. She
threw herself into Agnes's arms in a passion of
misery.</p>

<p>Agnes sat down and tried to make her comfortable
on her lap; but the child wailed and sobbed,
and gave way to such violent grief that the elder
sister was almost frightened, and looked towards
the window with a momentary thought of whether
it would be possible to recall her mother.</p>

<p>It was only momentary, for how could she?
Then her eyes fell on the new text, and her heart,
with a throb of joy, realized that the Lord was
with her.</p>

<p>"Always," she said to herself; "so that must
mean to-day. 'Lord, what wilt Thou have me
to do?'"</p>

<p>She bent her head over the little golden one,
and clasped her arms tighter round the trembling
little form, and then she said softly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Minnie, have you read our text since father and
mother went?"</p>

<p>Minnie listened, but only for an instant, then she
sobbed louder than ever.</p>

<p>"Minnie," again pursued Agnes, "do you think
you are carrying out what <i>He</i> would have you do?"</p>

<p>Minnie stopped a little, and clung more lovingly
than before to her sister's waist.</p>

<p>"We must be sorry they are gone; we can't help
it, and I don't think Jesus wants us to help it; but
we ought not to give way to such grief as to seem
rebellious to what He has ordered."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am?" asked the child brokenly.</p>

<p>"What do you think yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," hesitating.</p>

<p>"Well, think about it for a moment. Look here.
Minnie, I want to put up these things that are
scattered about, so I will lay you on the sofa and
cover you up warm; then you can think about it
while you watch me. Come, Alice dear, you and
I shall soon make things look brighter if we try."</p>

<p>Alice had been standing gazing rather forlornly
at Minnie, but now turned round with alacrity.
To do something would divert her sorrowful
thoughts.</p>

<p>By-and-by a heavy sigh from Minnie made her
sisters look at her. There she lay like a picture, her
long curls tossed about over the sofa cushion like
a halo, her dark eyelashes resting on her flushed
cheeks, where the tears were hardly dry, asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a good thing," said Alice in a low tone.
"I thought she would cry herself ill."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad," answered Agnes, looking down
upon her. "But, Alice, the boys will be back
before we have done if we stand talking."</p>

<p>"Then we won't. Agnes, did not aunt Phyllis
say she would come in early?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I hope she will not till we have put
away everything. Just take up that heap and
come upstairs with me, Alice; and then run down
for that one, will you? You don't mind?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to 'mind' anything, as Hugh
says," answered Alice earnestly, a tear just sparkling
in the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>"That's a dear girl; it will make everything so
much easier if you do that."</p>

<p>"I mean to try."</p>

<p>They left the room, closing the door after them,
and went up with their loads&mdash;papers, string,
packing-canvas, cardboard boxes, rubbish, shawls,
and what not.</p>

<p>Agnes placed the various things in their places,
while Alice watched and handed them to her, and
at last all was done and the girls ran down, just as
a double rap sounded through the hall.</p>

<p>"That's auntie's knock, I shall open it," exclaimed
Alice, and in a moment she admitted a
little lady, whose pale delicate face and stooping
attitude betokened constant ill health.</p>

<p>"Well, my dears," she said cheerfully, "I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57]</a></span>
you would have a few things to do after such an
early starting, so I waited for a little time. Are
the boys back yet?"</p>

<p>"No; we expect them every moment," answered
Agnes, leading her aunt into the now orderly
dining-room, and placing her in an arm-chair.</p>

<p>Miss Headley's eyes wandered round in search
of little Minnie, and soon she saw the sleeping
child.</p>

<p>"Not ill?" she asked, reassuring herself with her
eyes before Agnes answered:</p>

<p>"She was tired with excitement, I think, and
grief. I am so glad she is asleep."</p>

<p>"The best thing for her. And they got off
well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but I hardly knew how utterly dreadful
it would be to feel I could not call them back!"</p>

<p>Agnes turned away; she could not say any
more. While the responsibility rested on her
alone she had been brave, but now with her aunt's
sympathy so near she began to feel as if she must
break down.</p>

<p>"I know," said the soft voice, "do not mind
me, my child; come here and let me comfort you."</p>

<p>Agnes knelt down and laid her head on her
aunt's shoulder, while one or two convulsive sobs
relieved her burdened heart.</p>

<p>"There will often be moments when you would
give anything to have them here, my child; but
the Lord knows just that, and has sent forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58]</a></span>
strength for thee to meet it all. We never know
how very dear and precious He can be till we've
got no one else."</p>

<p>"I shall learn it soon," whispered Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child; and it is such a mercy to know
that He suits our discipline to our exact need.
The other day I was on a visit in the country, and
had to go to an instrument-maker there to do
something for my back. He told me he could not
help me at all, for my case was so very peculiar,
and he had nothing to suit me. But that's not
like the Lord, my child. He knows us too intimately
for that. He does not think our case too
peculiar for His skill, but holds in His tender
hand just the support, just the strengthening, just
the treatment we want, and He gives us what will
be the very best for us."</p>

<p>Agnes and Alice knew to what their aunt
referred. An accident when she was a beautiful
young woman of twenty had caused her life-long
suffering, and obliged her to wear a heavy instrument
which often gave her great pain and
weariness.</p>

<p>Her niece raised her hand at those gentle words,
and stroked her aunt's face lovingly.</p>

<p>"It is resting to know He understands perfectly,
my child, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very. But oh, auntie, I wish you hadn't to
suffer so!"</p>

<p>"Don't wish that, my dear, but rejoice that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59]</a></span>
every trial that has ever come to me, I can say,
'His grace has been sufficient for me.'"</p>

<p>Agnes knelt on in silence; and aunt Phyllis did
not attempt to disturb the quiet till some hasty
footsteps were heard along the pavement, which
came springing up the steps, and in another
moment the two boys, fresh from their walk, came
bursting into the room; but not before Agnes had
sprung up and seated herself at the table with her
work.</p>

<p>"Hulloa, Agnes! Why, auntie, is that you? So
you've come to look after the forsaken nest, have
you?"</p>

<p>"How did they get off, John?" Agnes asked,
looking up as quietly as if she had been sitting
there for an hour.</p>

<p>"Very well; mother was cheerful to the last."</p>

<p>"And they had a foot-warmer?"</p>

<p>"Your humble servant saw to that."</p>

<p>"And you got them something to read?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have anything."</p>

<p>"And they did not leave any more messages?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. Now, Hugh, as Agnes has
pumped me dry, let Alice take a turn at <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Alice, till her brothers came in, had been leaning
over the fire, deeply buried in a book and
now turned round to it again, as if she would
very much rather read than do anything else.</p>

<p>Hugh seeing this, advanced a step nearer, and
his eyes looked mischievous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Alice, don't perfectly smother a body
with questions. One at a time. What's the
first?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I haven't any to ask."</p>

<p>"You mean you're too busy?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Alice, half vexed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're cold, you're such a long way
off from that tiny fire!"</p>

<p>"I'm not cold," said Alice, putting her hand up
to her glowing face.</p>

<p>"Not? Now I really thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a gentle voice interrupted what was becoming
too hot for poor Alice's temper, and aunt Phyllis
said:</p>

<p>"Grandmama invites you all to dinner to-day,
my dears, at two o'clock; will you come?"</p>

<p>At the word dinner Agnes started. "Oh dear,
auntie, I forgot it was my duty now to see after
dinner! I do not believe I should have thought of
it for ever so long."</p>

<p>"Cook would have reminded you, I dare say,"
said her aunt, smiling.</p>

<p>"What are you boys going to do this morning?"
asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"I'm going to my room to have a general turn
out for the holidays, and shall not be visible again
till five minutes to two."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing," said Agnes, laughing.</p>

<p>"Your politeness is only exceeded by your truth,"
said John, giving his aunt a kiss, and disappearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61]</a></span>
through the door before Agnes could give him
back an answer, had she wished it.</p>

<p>"And what is Hugh going to do?" asked Miss
Headley, turning to him.</p>

<p>"Tease Alice," said Hugh, nodding towards the
crouching figure by the fire.</p>

<p>"I was going to say that I have to go to see a
woman in Earl Street, and wanted you to carry
my basket for me, Hugh. Can you spare time, do
you think?"</p>

<p>"All right, auntie."</p>

<p>"Where's Hugh going?" said Minnie, sleepily,
opening her eyes.</p>

<p>"He is going out with me, darling; would you
like to go too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I think I 'm going to sleep again."</p>

<p>She turned her back on the room, and vouchsafed
no further notice of her aunt, nor of anyone
else. Agnes gave a glance of apology, but Miss
Headley answered by a look that it was not needed,
and in a few moments took her leave, followed by
her nephew, who ran in next door for the basket,
and caught her up before she had reached the
corner of the street.</p>

<p>Agnes left the room, and Alice woke up from
her book to find herself alone.</p>

<p>She was just going to stoop again over it, when
her eyes caught the unaccustomed frame upon the
wall, and she could not but see the words, "Lord,
what wilt Thou have me to do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've nothing to do but this now," she said,
drawing her shoulders nearer to the blaze. "It's
holiday time, and I have not lessons or duties of
any kind; I may do as I like."</p>

<p>But though she tried to read, she could not
forget that question. At first she determined to
shake it off, but by-and-by her book fell closed on
to her lap, and she looked up straight at the words,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"This is the first way I am keeping my resolves;
a pretty way!"</p>

<p>"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"</p>

<p>Then she waited, as her father had said&mdash;waited,
looking at the words as if they would shine out
with an answer. And so they did; for as her eyes
rested on the last word, she suddenly started up.</p>

<p>"Do," she said, half aloud. "I don't suppose
He likes me to sit here idling my time. I wonder
if Agnes wants me? Or if not, I promised mother
to practise a whole hour every day, and as I am
going out to dinner I shall have to do that first."</p>

<p>Then her eyes met Minnie's wondering ones
shining out from among the golden curls and
crimson sofa cushion, and she heard a little voice
say:</p>

<p>"Who wants you to '<i>do</i>'?"</p>

<p>Alice pointed with her finger towards the text.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Minnie, comprehending.</p>

<p>"But I didn't remember you were there, or I
should not have spoken aloud."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgot what Agnes said, because I went to
sleep; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Alice, waiting for what the little
pet sister wanted to say.</p>

<p>"I don't think He would have liked me to cry so
<i>much</i>, if I had asked Him first."</p>

<p>And with another little sob she rushed past her
sister and flew up the stairs.</p>

<p>At five minutes to two o'clock, John opened his
bedroom door and called Agnes.</p>

<p>She was just coming out on the landing, with her
hat on, followed by Minnie and Alice.</p>

<p>"Come and see my arrangements," he said, opening
the door wider.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything particu&mdash;&mdash;Oh!" with
a start, "why, John, where did you get that?"</p>

<p>"Out of these two hands of mine, to be sure,
and these eyes, and that paint box, and that cardboard."</p>

<p>On the wall hung the same text that their father
had prepared with such care downstairs, only that
John's was not framed, but put up with four small
nails.</p>

<p>"I thought I should see it more up here than
downstairs."</p>

<p>"And he thought," added Hugh slyly, "that <i>I</i>
should have the benefit of it here."</p>

<p>"I never thought of you at all," said John.</p>

<p>"It is very nice," said Agnes, coming in to
examine it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The others went down stairs, and the brother
and sister were left alone.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking a lot, Agnes," said John,
turning his back to her, as he busied himself at one
of his drawers, "and I've made up my mind while
I've been tracing the words of that text."</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Agnes, with a feeling
that there was something unusual in his tone.</p>

<p>"I've determined to take it as my life text."</p>

<p>"John!"</p>

<p>"Yes. It seemed so horrid without mother, and
I've been thinking about it, on and off, for a
year past; and to-day, as I painted those words.
I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Agnes was standing behind him, her soft cheek
resting against the back of his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>"He seemed to say to me, that the first thing I
had to <i>do</i> was to come to Him."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>sure</i> it is."</p>

<p>"So now you know," said John huskily.</p>

<p>"And you did come?" asked Agnes, feeling as
if she wanted to understand all before she could
rejoice.</p>

<p>"Of course," answered John, turning round
astonished; "I should not have said a word if that
had not been the end of it!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><i>THE FIRST SUNDAY ALONE.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i063b.png"
width="70" height="153" alt="T" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">he next morning dawned bright and
clear, and Agnes was the first awake.</p>

<p>She slipped on her dressing-gown, and
went across to her brothers' door and
tapped gently.</p>

<p>"It is time to get up," she called.</p>

<p>"All right, mother," answered a very sleepy
voice, and there was a comfortable sound of
smothering bedclothes, and then silence.</p>

<p>"Hugh and John, do wake," exclaimed shivering
Agnes; "we shall be late for church, if you go to
sleep again."</p>

<p>She tapped louder this time, and then John's
voice responded:</p>

<p>"All right, old woman; I'm awake now."</p>

<p>"Really, John?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"Really," said John; and she heard a bump on
the floor, and a pattering across the room.</p>

<p>She flew back, for if those feet were by chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66]</a></span>
Hugh's, a wet sponge would probably be trickling
down her neck before she had time to escape.</p>

<p>She had waked with the heartache, but her
brothers' cheerful laughter had turned her thoughts,
and as she dressed, though she considered soberly
her responsibility as head of the house, yet it was
trustfully too, and the remembrance of the great
joy which John's words yesterday had brought her,
made her so glad, that she felt ashamed of being
dull or mopish because her parents were gone.</p>

<p>So she went downstairs, looking as bright as if
no weight of care overshadowed her.</p>

<p>"This is our first day alone," she remarked as
they sat at breakfast, "for I do not count yesterday
anything, because we went out to dinner."</p>

<p>"I like going to grandmama's," said Hugh,
"for she always makes us jolly comfortable."</p>

<p>"That's Hugh's idea of bliss," said Alice
mischievously, "nothing to do&mdash;and plenty to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice!" exclaimed Agnes, shocked.</p>

<p>Hugh was not disconcerted, as it happened, but
answered:</p>

<p>"Well, what if it is? We're all in the same
boat it strikes me. One likes one sort of ease,
and another sort; but there isn't much to
choose between us."</p>

<p>"Thank you," laughed Alice, who was a little
ashamed of her home truth; "but my idea of
comfort isn't like yours, Hugh."</p>

<p>"What is yours, Alice?" asked John.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"A warm fire and an interesting book," said
Alice promptly.</p>

<p>"Like yesterday," said Hugh, whose memory
was often inconvenient.</p>

<p>"Like yesterday," assented Alice soberly, remembering
something about that which Hugh
knew nothing of.</p>

<p>"I hope you will all be ready in time for church,"
said John, "for I mean to start whether you are or
not. Agnes will be sure to be ready."</p>

<p>Agnes acknowledged the compliment with a
smile, but candour forced her to add, "I'm afraid
I'm not always ready."</p>

<p>Then they rose from the table, and Agnes stood
hesitating for a moment, while the colour mounted
into her face.</p>

<p>"John," she whispered, "could you take prayers,
do you think?"</p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>"I thought, perhaps, since yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes," he returned, "you'll do it twice as
well; and the servants, and all&mdash;you will not mind.
You were going to, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was; and if you would rather I did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Much rather&mdash;of course I would. You need
not be nervous."</p>

<p>The whispered conversation was unheeded by
the others, who had gathered round the fire looking
at their mother's bullfinch taking his morning bath
on the mantelshelf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you won't forget his royal highness,"
said Hugh to Alice.</p>

<p>"I do not suppose I shall."</p>

<p>"If you do I'll remind you," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"When it is starved to death," answered Hugh.</p>

<p>Minnie looked distressed, and Alice rather
defiant. "I mean to attend to him every morning
before I taste my own breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure we shall think of him," said
Agnes, joining the circle, while her hand pulled the
bell for the servants, "we are so used to giving
him his bath that his food will be sure to be
remembered."</p>

<p>And then they sat down for their first prayers
without their parents; and Agnes read with a
voice that trembled nervously at first, but as she
proceeded she took courage. Their text flashed
across her, and she felt that what He wished her to
do now was just this, and the thought made her
wonderfully happy.</p>

<p>When they sat at dinner&mdash;Agnes taking the top
of the table and John the bottom&mdash;Hugh exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How awfully funny it is without father and
mother!"</p>

<p>Minnie looked up quickly, and then looked
down, and her knife and fork fell from her
fingers.</p>

<p>John turned towards her kindly. "Why, Minnie,"
he said, "think how much good the change may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69]</a></span>
do them; and if it were <i>you</i>, you would want to
see your own mother, wouldn't you, after twenty
years?"</p>

<p>This roused Minnie's sympathy. She had never
thought such a thing possible before as being
separated from her mother for so long; so she
swallowed down her tears and began her dinner,
which, in spite of her woe-begone feelings, tasted
very nice.</p>

<p>"What shall you do with yourself after dinner.
John?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"I shall look out some texts I have to do, and
enter them into my book."</p>

<p>"What book?"</p>

<p>John hesitated. "One I began some little time
ago."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To enter special subjects in that I am interested
about."</p>

<p>"What sort of subjects?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Scripture subjects; or any others that seem to
me to belong to that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Hugh gave a little shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What time are you going to read to us, Agnes?"
asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"A little before four, I think. Hugh and Alice,
you have your scripture questions to do for father,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," they answered.</p>

<p>"Then, John, can you come in the drawing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70]</a></span>
to do your writing? Minnie and I shall not
disturb you."</p>

<p>He got up and followed her upstairs, smiling as
he went.</p>

<p>Turning round on the first landing she saw the
smile, and enquired:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You're a good general," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Take care to separate your different regiments
in case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John!"</p>

<p>"Now, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you!"</p>

<p>"Well, come along; you cannot say that my
generalship has not made you comfortable, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to. What a glorious fire, Agnes;
and what a nice arm-chair; and what a jolly little
table; and what a nice inkstand; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, John, leave off, or our afternoon will be
gone; and those children will be up before we
have had a moment's quiet."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the sofa, at one side of
the fire, Minnie curling herself up by her with
her book, and Agnes opening her Bible and
bending over it.</p>

<p>Silence reigned for an hour; while John's pen
scratched, and the leaves of his concordance turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[ 71]</a></span>
over; and Agnes's eyes were fixed on one page,
from which she hardly raised them, except to give
Minnie an occasional caress, or to whisper something
to her about her book.</p>

<p>At last there was a stir downstairs. Chairs were
pushed back; careful Alice put on some coal, that
the fire might not be out when they returned to it;
and then there was a rush, and the two came
tearing up the stairs.</p>

<p>"How jolly comfortable you look!" exclaimed
Hugh.</p>

<p>"We are," said John, preparing to close his book.</p>

<p>"Any room on the sofa for a fellow?" asked
Hugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! plenty."</p>

<p>"Sit next me," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"All right. I say, Agnes, how strange it will
seem to have Christmas Day without them!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but we can make it happy if we try," said
Agnes.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By <i>being</i> happy."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Hugh; "but then,
you know, Agnes, <i>being</i> made happy depends on
outward things."</p>

<p>"Of course it does; and on inward things too.
If we have got a well of happiness inside us, it
will make everything round us seem bright and
beautiful."</p>

<p>"What do you call a 'well of happiness'?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what Agnes means," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"I was thinking then of the day father came
home from America&mdash;last time; and we had
received the telegram that he had landed at
Liverpool. How we all went about singing and
happy; how we never thought of quarrelling, but
hastened to get everything ready for him."</p>

<p>"I remember that day," said Alice; "it was one
of the nicest I ever spent."</p>

<p>"So that is what I mean by a 'well of happiness;'
something which gives us joy, independently of
anything else."</p>

<p>"And what's your Christmas 'well of joy' for
this year, Agnes?" asked John with a smile.</p>

<p>Agnes gave an answering smile. "Oh, John, it
is that we are His; that, through the coming of
the dear Saviour, we have been given all other
blessings&mdash;happiness and peace here, everlasting
joy hereafter."</p>

<p>"And you think that ought to make up for all
other deficiencies?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"If we have <i>got</i> it," said Alice thoughtfully;
"but sometimes I wonder&mdash;&mdash;" she looked down,
and tears glittered in her eyes.</p>

<p>Agnes heard the quiver in the tone, and put her
arm lovingly round her sister. "Is it so difficult to
know?"</p>

<p>Alice shook her head.</p>

<p>"He gives the Holy Spirit to them that ask
Him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The little party were silent; Alice's unusual
feeling startled them. The Sunday afternoon was
drawing in, and the light fading.</p>

<p>Presently Agnes said, "I have thought of a little
allegory; would you like to hear it? It might
help us to understand Alice's difficulty."</p>

<p>The question did not need repeating, and she
began:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><i>THE GOLDEN OIL: AN ALLEGORY.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i072b.png"
width="44" height="110" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap"> fell
asleep and dreamed. Before me
spread out verdant fields, picturesque
villages, valleys of peace and plenty,
cities of care and toil, the wide ocean
restlessly tossing, the mountain bare and
rugged.</p>

<p>At first my eyes seemed heavy with sleep, but
after a time I began to see things more clearly, and
in all these varied scenes I perceived there were
children moving to and fro.</p>

<p>I was apparently at a great distance from
them, and could not well understand what they
did, nor could I hear what they said.</p>

<p>They appeared to be very busy, often eagerly
running or walking; talking together in twos and
threes; playing with the trifles which seemed to lie
everywhere for their amusement; sometimes two
quarrelling loudly over these same trifles, and
crying pitifully if they could not have what they
wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75]</a></span></p>

<p>In my dream I seemed to be drawing nearer
and nearer to them, and I began to perceive the
differences in their countenances and dress, and to
find that there was only one point of resemblance
in them all; and this one thing caused me great
surprise.</p>

<p>Some were robed in dresses whose sheen,
reflecting the rays of the morning sun, dazzled my
eyes; again, others had garments of the dullest
hue; and the clothes of others were so covered
with mud and dirt, that I could not have told what
they once were. But, whether gaily decked or
dressed in sombre attire, each child had fastened
round it a curiously-fashioned girdle, to which
hung a small pitcher. The pitchers appeared to
be all of one shape and size, but the materials of
which they were made seemed to differ widely.</p>

<p>On some of the children, whose dress was of
gayest hue, the pitcher, strange to say, appeared to
be made of commonest material, for it looked dull
and dark; while at the girdle of some who were
most plainly attired hung vessels of brightest gold.
This also was incomprehensible to me.</p>

<p>Presently my dream seemed to bring me so
near that I could see what they were doing and
hear a little of what they said.</p>

<p>A group of them were sitting on a bank of
flowers, resting in the shade, and as they talked I
drew near to listen.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it," said a sturdy little boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76]</a></span>
as he threw a ball of flowers into the lap of a little
maiden opposite.</p>

<p>"What do you not believe?" asked a grave-looking
girl who was seated near.</p>

<p>"That there is any hurry to get the pitchers
filled."</p>

<p>"Did any one say there was?" asked the girl,
glancing thoughtfully at the vessel hanging at her
side, while I perceived that it had the look of being
neglected and soiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a proclamation this morning
that the pitchers might be needed this very day,
and that all who had not the Golden Oil should,
without delay, repair to the place whence it could be
obtained."</p>

<p>"So there is every day," exclaimed a tall
youth who was lying on the grass at their feet.
"That is nothing new: it is the duty of the
Herald to proclaim, and it is our duty to hear,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one ever thinks of obeying," laughed the
roguish boy, weaving his flowers as if all his life
were centred in doing that only.</p>

<p>But the thoughtful girl looked up with a deep
flush at those careless words. "I do not think
<i>every one</i> does that, Ashton; for Esther here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pointed to a child at a little distance who
was threading daisies together wherewith to deck a
tiny brother, who sat watching her little fingers
with absorbed interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[ 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that my attention was directed to this
little girl, I took note of her for the first time.
Her dress was of some white material, her eyes
clear as the deep summer azure, her face full of
sunshine, while close to her heart a golden pitcher
gleamed in the light, as her happy little figure
turned backwards and forwards in her task.</p>

<p>"Oh, Esther always obeys!" said the youth
from the grass, "and is the happiest little mortal
in doing so; but that would not suit every
one."</p>

<p>He turned round restlessly, and any one who
cared might see that his pitcher was empty enough
as it lay on the ground under his arm.</p>

<p>Esther was all unconscious that the eyes of the
party were fixed upon her. When she had
completed her chain of daisies, she took her little
brother's hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Now, darling," she said softly, "you promised
me you would go at once to get your little pitcher
filled."</p>

<p>He nodded and trotted off by her side, while
she continued, "It would be so sad not to have any
Oil when night comes on, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"But you could lend me some," answered the
child, confident in her love.</p>

<p>"You know I can't; I must not; no one can
lend. So that is why I want you to get some for
yourself."</p>

<p>As they turned round to go towards the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78]</a></span>
where I imagined the Golden Oil was to be
obtained, I saw another strange thing about these
children which I had not noticed before; each
carried, fastened to the same girdle, a tiny lamp.
I looked round to enquire the meaning of it all, but
found myself unable to speak; so I could do
nothing but follow the two children to see what
would become of them.</p>

<p>"But why must we have our lamps lighted.
Esther?" asked the little one; "I go to sleep all
night."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Esther; "but every night before I
go to sleep I trim and light my lamp, and then, if
the King were to come, I should only have to
jump up and run out to welcome Him."</p>

<p>"But I should take hold of your hand, Esther!"
said the little man.</p>

<p>"Oh, but the King says we must <i>obey</i>, Ernest;
it is of no use thinking you will do all those things.
You might not be able to find me in the dark, nor
find the King. He tells us to ask for the Golden
Oil, and to trim the golden lamp, and we have
nothing to do but obey."</p>

<p>Esther pressed his little hand, and they
hastened on. Presently, just by the side of the
road I saw a Herald standing, with an open book
in his hand, and though I could not catch all
the words he said, I saw that the children understood.</p>

<p>"I do not like to go in," little Ernest was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79]</a></span>
urging, as he pulled back Esther's hand; "I am
afraid to."</p>

<p>"But the Herald says, 'Whosoever <i>will</i>,' that
means you, Ernest darling."</p>

<p>Then they turned in under an archway, Ernest,
now that his mind was made up, running on
before.</p>

<p>Esther waited just inside the gate. She could
not follow right into the chamber where the Oil
was given away, for each one who would get
his vessel filled with the Golden Oil must go in
alone to receive it.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes Ernest came out again,
bearing the golden pitcher full of Golden Oil.
His face was radiant, and as he took Esther's hand
once more, he looked up into her face with large,
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"Esther," he said, "the King came down and
spoke to me Himself, and put His hand on my
head, and charged me to listen to the Herald's
message, and to obey."</p>

<p>Esther's eyes glistened. "Is He not a gracious
King, Ernest?" she said.</p>

<p>As my eyes followed these children I perceived
that the possession of the Golden Oil seemed to
bring them happiness and peace.</p>

<p>Everywhere they went they did loving little
actions, said kind little words. Sometimes I wondered
at the very smallness of these actions and
words; and yet, as I noticed the faces brighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80]</a></span>
on whom they fell, I knew that they were understood
and appreciated.</p>

<p>By-and-by Esther joined the group of children
from whom she had parted but a while ago. The
sun had risen higher in the heavens, and had
begun to descend by the time she and Ernest
returned to them; but still they were where they
had been, and were occupied in much the same
way as before.</p>

<p>The tall boy in the grass had sauntered away
for a walk with another companion, and though he
again passed the Herald, his warning voice was
still unheeded.</p>

<p>Esther sat down by the girl whom I had observed
as being anxious about the Golden Oil, and as
little Ernest ran to play with some other children
Esther said, "I wish you had been with us, Allea;
we have had such a happy morning."</p>

<p>"I cannot see that a walk with a little prattling
brother can give such delight," she answered.</p>

<p>"But we have been to get his pitcher filled.
Oh, Allea, I went almost into the presence of the
King!"</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was never so near before, except the
day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When?" asked Allea, looking into Esther's
face.</p>

<p>"When He gave me the Oil Himself."</p>

<p>"You make so much of having this Oil," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81]</a></span>
Allea, discontentedly; "more than half the world
gets on very well without it."</p>

<p>Esther looked abashed for a moment. This
was true certainly. Then her eyes were raised to
the blue vault of the sky above her, and beyond it
she saw, what all those who received the Golden
Oil could see if they looked, a mystic word
written&mdash;Eternity!&mdash;and as she read and re-read
its well-known letters, they seemed to melt away
and transform themselves into a wondrous palace
of beauty and light, where her King dwelt, and
where He had promised to take those who obeyed
Him during this little Journey. Still absorbed in
the sight, she gazed upward till one by one the
azure towers and palaces faded back; but before
it vanished from her sight, once more the word
Eternity stood like a fleecy cloud upon the blue,
and then melted away.</p>

<p>Then her eyes came back to her companion's
face: "Yes, Allea, you are quite right, half the
world does very well without it <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Allea impatiently.</p>

<p>"But when this little Journey is ended, or
when night comes on, if the King suddenly calls
us to come with Him, then, oh, Allea! what
would it be to be shut out of the Everlasting
City?"</p>

<p>Allea was silent, while one or two children who
had noticed the earnestness of their talk had
gathered round them to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82]</a></span>.
"Will you not get your pitcher filled to-day.
Allea?" pleaded Esther with wistful eyes.</p>

<p>"By-and-by," she answered; "I shall be passing
that way this evening."</p>

<p>"The night cometh when no one can work,"
whispered Esther, as if to herself.</p>

<p>"But I am going before night," answered Allea
somewhat proudly; "you are too fast, Esther."</p>

<p>As they sat and talked, I fancied that shadows
began to fall over the land. The children did not
seem to heed it at first, but presently they seemed
divided one from another by the deepening twilight,
and before I knew where I was, I found myself
following Esther and her little brother, who held
by the hand one of the children who had been
listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>Again we approached the portal where the
Herald stood, and I could see that Ernest and
Esther were both hurrying forward with all their
speed, helping their companion along, who, though
hastening as much as she could, seemed weary and
spent.</p>

<p>Ever and anon upon the quiet evening air the
Herald's voice sounded clear and full, 'The time is
short&mdash;the day is far spent&mdash;ask and it shall be
given you;' and as they ran under the archway
darkness fell upon the land, and I could not follow
them.</p>

<p>But while I pondered on these things, I saw a
little glimmering light in a casement, and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[ 83]</a></span>
drawn to approach near enough to see what it was.
As I came close I could see the interior of a small
chamber; hard by on a couch lay Esther, fast
asleep, with her little brother's arms flung about
her neck. Close beside them, and still fastened by
golden links to their waists, stood the two Golden
Lamps, burning brightly and steadily, while a
King's Messenger, arrayed in white apparel, waited
near, guarding the sleepers and the Lamps with
watchful care.</p>

<p>Long did I look, and was at last turning away,
when a strange sound startled the midnight air:
"Your King cometh! your King cometh!"</p>

<p>At the words, so long looked for, so eagerly
expected, Esther sprang from her rest, caught her
Lamp in her hand, looked round with joyful eyes
for her little brother, who had also heard that cry,
and then both ran out to meet the King. Did I
see their companion of the evening before, holding
aloft a Golden Lamp too, to welcome Him?</p>

<p>And then I thought I heard confused tones of
regret, and sorrow, and wailing disappointment, as
one and another, awakened by the lights and glad
sounds, hastened from their couches&mdash;not to meet
the King; alas! no&mdash;but to find He had come,
and had taken those who were ready, into His
glorious Palace, to go no more out for ever.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"Agnes," said Minnie, looking up solemnly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84]</a></span>
her sister's face, "I think I know, but isn't the Oil
in that story meant for the Holy Spirit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, and the promise stands fresh and
sure now, as it did eighteen hundred years ago, 'If
ye...know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your Heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
Him.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3><i>A CUPBOARD OF RUBBISH.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i083b.png"
width="73" height="118" alt="W" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">hat
are you searching for?" asked
Agnes, entering the schoolroom the
next morning, which was littered over
from end to end. Her brothers and
sisters were busily engaged in turning
out a large cupboard, and the contents
were scattered all over the room.</p>

<p>They looked up with rather flushed faces.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes," exclaimed Minnie eagerly, "we
are sorting my old toys over, to see what I can
spare."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Why, for those poor little
children who haven't any toys or pleasures!"</p>

<p>"Which children? I never heard."</p>

<p>"Didn't you? not what mother told us the other
day?"</p>

<p>"No," said Agnes, sitting down by the fire and
surveying the confusion with some curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then <i>I'll</i> tell you," burst out Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, you tell her," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Well, they say that there are numbers and
numbers of children who have hardly any enjoyment
in their lives, who are sick and full of suffering,
lying on beds with nothing to do, or seated in
chairs from which they cannot move. The kind
people at the hospital do all they can for them,
you know, Agnes; but of course they must spend
their money on necessary things, and on beds and
food, and they cannot afford to buy toys."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Mother told us that <i>anything</i> almost would be
a treat to these poor little things, and so we are
seeing what we have got."</p>

<p>"But this is all rubbish," said Agnes, speaking
regretfully, for she felt sorry to disappoint her
eager brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>They were not so easily daunted, however,
having heard what very old toys give infinite
delight to the poor little invalids, and Hugh
answered:</p>

<p>"But you see, Agnes, these are for their very
own, and when we have mended them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, if they are mended, of course, that is a
different thing," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"So we shall," said Minnie; "see, the glue-pot
is on already, and we are going to begin soon."</p>

<p>"The worst is," said Hugh, "where shall we
begin, this is in such a muddle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will help you," said Agnes kindly, "if you
will give me any idea of what you mean to
send."</p>

<p>"Well," said John, who had been persuaded to
help, "here are some dominoes. You know we've
that nice new set, and there are a good many of
these, only the box is broken. What could we do
for a box, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Would a little bag do?"</p>

<p>John looked doubtful; but Alice, who had been
busily sorting out while the others had been talking,
seized upon the idea of a bag as the very thing,
and wrote down on a piece of paper, "Wanted, a
bag for dominoes."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Agnes; "now what next?"</p>

<p>"Here is a little horse with his head off; but I
know the head is somewhere, and we shall come
across it presently."</p>

<p>"That's for the glueing heap, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Thank you, Agnes; now we shall
get on," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Here is a lot of small furniture, but it is very
broken," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a few of them will do. Have you the
box?"</p>

<p>"Here is an empty one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have a little dolly to put in with
them?"</p>

<p>Alice went to a corner and produced a dilapidated
Dutch doll.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will put her on a new frock while you sort
the things," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Here is a bit of pink chintz," answered Minnie;
"and here are my scissors to 'pink' the edges."</p>

<p>The heap for glueing was fast increasing, and
John said he had better begin, while the others
collected for him.</p>

<p>"We have agreed not to quarrel over it," he
added, smiling, "but to do whatever comes first,
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>Minnie came close to her, and said softly, "We
are trying to do something for <i>His</i> sake, you know.
Agnes."</p>

<p>"I see," said Agnes; "I am so glad."</p>

<p>But though the glueing might be pleasant work,
the sorting out such a heap of <i>dbris</i> was a tiring
thing, and taxed the patience of the children very
much. Agnes sat by, helping with advice and
interest, and feeling deep down in her heart that
she was giving her little service to the Lord Jesus
too. Had she not left the piano, where she had
but just opened a new song? Had she not made
all her arrangements to have an hour's practice this
morning, when she could be certain of the piano to
herself? But all this had been put aside, and now
she heard the tender voice whispering, "Thou hast
been faithful over a few things...enter into the
joy of thy Lord."</p>

<p>And even now she was tasting that joy, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89]</a></span>
some day, all who love Him, shall know in its
fulness.</p>

<p>At last the floor was clear, and Hugh ran downstairs
with a basketful of real rubbish, while the
table now held many heaps, over which careful
Alice kept guard.</p>

<p>"Not there," she would say, as a contribution
was brought; "that must be for this heap, and
those broken toys for John to glue."</p>

<p>When Hugh returned with his empty basket,
they surveyed the present results of their labours.
A heap of already mended toys, carefully bound
together with thin string; a lot of pictures and
scraps to be pasted into old copy books, of which
several lay at hand; two or three very old dolls,
which were to be freshened up, some with a little
soap and water, some with a bit of odd ribbon,
some with a new glazed lining frock, just run together
and snipped out at the bottom; a few boxes
containing the remains of dolls' furniture, dominoes,
little cups and saucers, and the like; an old six-penny
watch, with a bit of pink tape for a guard;
and last, an old doll's perambulator, which John
was now busily engaged in renovating.</p>

<p>Minnie looked at the things, while a deep sigh
escaped her, "I wish we could do more," she said,
"but we have so little money."</p>

<p>"We must remember," said Agnes, "that God
accepts, not according to what we have <i>not</i>, but
according to what we have."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh; "and if we were to sit down
to do nothing because we have no money to spend,
quite thirty little children would go without what
will give them a good many hours' pleasure."</p>

<p>"So they would," answered Minnie, looking more
cheerful; "so now I will set about making the best
of what I have."</p>

<p>It took a good many days before all the things
were really completed; and sometimes they were
tempted to get tired and give up; but one or other
of them would remember for whom they had agreed
to work, and this nerved them to make a fresh
endeavour.</p>

<p>At last all was done. A box was found to send
the things in, and the pleasant task of actually
packing it was begun.</p>

<p>Agnes told them to let her know when everything
was ready, and now came in, bearing a little tray-full
of tiny bags of net, filled with sugar-plums.</p>

<p>She proceeded to tie one on each toy or doll, and
placed one in a sly corner in the various toy boxes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes, how kind of you!" they all exclaimed.</p>

<p>So the packing went on with great zest.</p>

<p>They all clubbed together to pay the carriage of
the box by the Parcels Delivery Company, and with
great pride Alice wrote the label, and pasted it on.
Then Hugh and John carried the package into the
hall, and when they came up again they all looked
at each other with happy faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought it would never get done," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Alice; "there is nothing like
perseverance to get things finished."</p>

<p>"It is bringing forth fruit with <i>patience</i>," said
Agnes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3><i>JOHN'S PROMISE.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i090b.png"
width="55" height="118" alt="T" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">hus
the few days before Christmas
passed busily on, while Agnes began to
feel less anxiety as to her charge during
their parents' absence.</p>

<p>The nearness of her grandmother and
aunt were an untold comfort, but her
mother had said to her before she left, "Do not
run in to them with every little tittle-tattle, but
remember there is a nearer Friend always close.
Should any great emergency arise, be thankful
that He has so placed you that you can ask advice
of them."</p>

<p>The whole family, according to the usual custom,
were to spend Christmas-day at Mrs. Headley's,
next door, to which pleasure the young people
looked forward in their different ways.</p>

<p>On Christmas-eve, while John, Hugh, and Alice
were making and putting up the ivy and holly
wreaths, Agnes and Minnie set forth on their
errand of carrying the Christmas parcels to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93]</a></span>
poor people for whom they had prepared them;
and when they came in, wet and cold, the others
gathered round to know what they had done, and
how the parcels had been received.</p>

<p>"It is bitterly cold to-night," said Agnes, coming
forward to the fire; "you will let us get warm
first, before we say a word, the wind blows through
you."</p>

<p>"You should have let us go," said John. "I knew
it was more fit for Hugh and me than for that little
scrap of humanity!"</p>

<p>"But Minnie was promised," answered Agnes,
"and I am <i>very</i> glad I went&mdash;very glad."</p>

<p>"So am I," answered Minnie earnestly.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"I must tell you another day; to-night I feel as
if I could only thank God for all our mercies."</p>

<p>She sat down by the fire and looked into it
abstractedly, while Minnie stood near her very
soberly too.</p>

<p>"Were they so pleased?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>Agnes looked round on the warm room, with its
comfortable curtains, clean wall-paper, tidy carpet,
all lighted up with the glow of the log of wood
which Alice had put on the fire to welcome her.</p>

<p>"If you could have seen!" she said, "how thankful
you would all feel for <i>our</i> blessings."</p>

<p>At six o'clock the next morning the Christmas
bells of joy rang out on the still morning air.
They woke Alice, and she started up in bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94]</a></span>
called to Minnie, who, after sundry groans and
sighs, came to herself, and asked, "What is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's the matter, only don't you want to
hear the Christmas bells?"</p>

<p>"Not very much," answered Minnie sleepily.</p>

<p>"You are a goose!" said broad-awake Alice.
"But all the same, I wish you a happy Christmas."</p>

<p>"So do I," answered Minnie, trying to be polite;
"but when I really wake up to-morrow morning
I'll say it better."</p>

<p>"Why it <i>is</i> to-morrow morning," laughed Alice.</p>

<p>After breakfast, just as they were going to open
a package on which they had ventured many
conjectures, a ring at the front door interrupted
them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's another parcel," said Minnie,
running to the window, while Agnes exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Minnie, don't expect things, pray. I should
not like to be counting on presents&mdash;it is horrid!"</p>

<p>Minnie looked round astonished. "I didn't
know&mdash;&mdash;" she said, confused.</p>

<p>But the ring was quickly explained.</p>

<p>"Please, Master Hugh," said the housemaid,
"there's a young gentleman in the hall, and he
wants to know if you'll go out for a walk with
him?"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Hugh, vexed. "Did he say
his name?"</p>

<p>"I'll enquire, Master Hugh."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[ 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Master Tom Radnor," she said, returning.</p>

<p>Hugh threw down the string he was untying,
and followed the maid into the hall.</p>

<p>"Holloa, Tom!" he said.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to do to-day," said the other;
"and you said you'd go for a walk."</p>

<p>"You're remarkably early, or else we're remarkably
late."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but I'm busy just this minute."</p>

<p>"Not done breakfast?" asked Tom, grinning.</p>

<p>"You're wrong there! Look here, Tom, I'll
call for you in half an hour, will that do?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>So the front door opened and closed, and Hugh
came back.</p>

<p>"What did he want?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"To go for a walk."</p>

<p>"On Christmas-day? How funny."</p>

<p>"Not funny that I know of."</p>

<p>"Did you ask him to?" said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;at least he said something about it
when I met him yesterday."</p>

<p>"I should have said I couldn't," said Alice
decidedly; "but never mind now, Hugh, let's
open our things."</p>

<p>They gathered round the table, and soon had
forgotten all about Tom in their interest in the
presents their mother and father had prepared for
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96]</a></span></p>

<p>A beautiful work-basket for Agnes; a book for
John; a new paint-box for Hugh; a desk, fitted-up,
for Alice; and a long-shaped box for Minnie,
on which was written, "Care&mdash;great care&mdash;little
Minnie."</p>

<p>"What can it be?" exclaimed the child, peeping
round it, and enjoying her anticipations.</p>

<p>And then John untied the string and raised the
cover, while Minnie's little fingers tenderly lifted
some tissue-paper, and disclosed to view a baby-doll
of surpassing loveliness.</p>

<p>Agnes and the rest admired and exclaimed to
the heart's content of the little mother, and then
She took her doll away to show it to the servants.</p>

<p>Just then Hugh discovered that the half hour
was nearly over, and started up.</p>

<p>"Are you not coming to church?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>Hugh stopped short for a moment, "Are you?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going with Aunt Phyllis."</p>

<p>"But I can't get out of this, Agnes, and father
wouldn't mind?"</p>

<p>"No; he thinks Christmas-day is not like
Sunday, and we need not feel bound about going
to God's house as we are then; but for my own
part I should like to."</p>

<p>"So should I," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Is John going?" asked Hugh, looking crest-fallen
and vexed.</p>

<p>"Yes; I don't know that I had intended it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97]</a></span>
though, for I look upon Christmas-day as a blessed
holiday, but I've other reasons."</p>

<p>"Then you think I can go with Tom?"</p>

<p>"As far as that is concerned," said John; "but I
should hardly think Tom was a nice companion for
you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" exclaimed Hugh, turning red.</p>

<p>"There are several things about him that are
not satisfactory, and I should not like him for my
friend."</p>

<p>"He is not 'my friend' exactly; but that's
always the way with you, John, you despise other
people."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't; but I've always told you.
Hugh, that that boy's a humbug."</p>

<p>"How do you know he is?" Hugh answered
angrily.</p>

<p>"He never looks you in the face for one thing."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Did ever you hear such an absurd
thing, Agnes, to judge by a fellow's looks?"</p>

<p>"Then he does not go with the good set at
school, you can't say he does," pursued John.</p>

<p>"He goes with me, and I should like you to tell
me I belong to the bad set."</p>

<p>"You will if you go on with him," John answered
quickly; and then he saw Agnes move suddenly
and raise her eyes from the table, where they had
been fixed during the altercation.</p>

<p>One flash of thought, one glance at his sister,
and then John stood still with firmly-closed lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Agnes felt deeply thankful, but she said not a
word.</p>

<p>"Have you anything more to say?" asked Hugh
bitterly, "or have you exhausted all your powers
in that last effort?"</p>

<p>John was still silent, but an earnest supplication
went up that he might know his Lord's will and
do it.</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Hugh, coming close to him
and speaking to him in hot anger.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, Hugh," answered John slowly,
"wondering whether I had been unkind in what I
said, or right in warning you?"</p>

<p>"Warning me! If you had had a grain of sense
in your body, you'd have warned me in private,
and not before a pack of girls."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John, hesitating a little, "I
think I ought not&mdash;not like that, but it never
occurred to me; we got into it before I knew."</p>

<p>"That is a very poor excuse for annoying your
brother, and a very cowardly way of getting out of
it."</p>

<p>"Cowardly?" said Alice, beneath her breath, to
Agnes.</p>

<p>But John answered, "Having acknowledged
that I should have told you in private, Hugh, will
you forgive me? and may I come up with you and
talk it over?"</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed Hugh; "never mention the
subject to me again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99]</a></span></p>

<p>And with that he gathered his painting materials
together, and walked off, followed by Alice, who
was looking grieved enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes!" said John, turning to her, "I
meant to do right, but after all I have broken my
promise on Christmas-day!"</p>

<p>"I can't see that you have," answered Agnes
gently; "no one can guard against all difficulties."</p>

<p>"But I've quarrelled with him, and offended him
more deeply than ever before, when I meant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do not see that you quarrelled, John,
after all."</p>

<p>"It was far nearer to words than I ever dreamed
of going."</p>

<p>Agnes felt very sorrowful, but at last she looked
up.</p>

<p>"I wonder what <i>He</i> would have us do?" pointing
to the text.</p>

<p>John followed her glance for a moment, then he
left the room abruptly, and she heard his footsteps
going three at a time up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Hugh," he said, entering their joint room, and
closing the door, "I feel more sorry than words
can say about this."</p>

<p>His brother was sullenly preparing to go out,
and did not turn round. "Then you shouldn't
speak to a fellow so," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Hugh," answered John, seriously, "I dare not
unsay what I <i>said</i>; that part of it was right.
But I was wrong to have exposed your school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100]</a></span>
affairs before anyone else. Can't you let us be
friends again on Christmas-day? I would not
have had it happen for any money, and I am sorry
I have vexed you."</p>

<p>John's tone was so earnest, and Hugh's anger
had cooled down, so that he felt he could not do
less than say, uncomfortably, "Oh, well, there is no
need to make such a fuss; I'm sure I don't want
to bother about it, so there, we'll say no more."</p>

<p>John sat on the edge of the bed, looking dejected,
and Hugh finished his preparations, and
turned to the door. "Why do you mind so much?"
he asked suddenly, coming back again; for, after
all, he was a kind-hearted boy, and did not like to
see his brother annoyed.</p>

<p>"I have made two promises," said John, "and
have not succeeded in keeping either."</p>

<p>"Two promises?" echoed Hugh.</p>

<p>"One to Agnes, and one to God," said John in
a low tone half to himself.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Hugh, "I'm sorry I was so
cross; and&mdash;and I'll take to heart what you said
about Tom. I'm off now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3><i>HUGH'S PROMISE.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i099b.png"
width="42" height="112" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">t
was time to start for church, and John
went down to find his sisters.</p>

<p>His face was pale, and there was a
disappointed look about him which was
very unusual in the bright boy.</p>

<p>Agnes saw it, and walked along by his
side, trying to think of something cheering to say.
But, after all, when the heart is sore there is only
One who can truly comfort.</p>

<p>Alice and Minnie had gone in to fetch aunt
Phyllis, so the brother and sister were alone.</p>

<p>"Agnes," exclaimed John at last, when they came
in sight of the church, "I'm so vexed with myself,
so 'taken down a peg,' if you can comprehend such
a phrase."</p>

<p>He gave a little sad laugh to hide a deeper
feeling which Agnes perfectly understood.</p>

<p>"It's dreadfully unpleasant," she answered, "but
I've gone through it before now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Heaps of times. Don't you suppose, John, we
all trust in ourselves ever so much too much?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we do."</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged," she said cheerily, "it's
a comfort to feel He has got us in hand."</p>

<p>"What do you call 'in hand'?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Not letting us go our own way unhindered."</p>

<p>"But that's just what I didn't want, Agnes; I
wanted with all my heart to go His way, and yet I
failed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Agnes slowly; "and He knew that.
But perhaps, John&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say on."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;I don't know, I only guess by myself&mdash;perhaps
you felt you were strong, and could
stand alone."</p>

<p>Agnes glanced up with eyes that glittered with
tears as they went up the steps beneath the deep
portico.</p>

<p>John squeezed her arm, and they entered the
church.</p>

<p>If Agnes had given John a lesson, she had
taught herself one too. That Christmas morning
was a time never to be forgotten; and to John,
who had gone there hoping for a little quiet time
to renew his vows, to ask afresh what his Lord
would have him to do, there came a very different
discipline. Instead of being a soldier buckling on
his bright armour, he found himself a beaten-down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103]</a></span>
combatant who was returning home wounded and
sore.</p>

<p>But a comforting thought came to him as he
knelt with his face buried in his hands; all the
same for his wounds and feeling of defeat, he was
fighting under the great Captain, who loved him in
spite of all.</p>

<p>And when the text was given out his lesson
came home to him, and he raised his head joyfully
as his eyes sought those of his sister.</p>

<p>"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from
falling, and to present you faultless before His
presence with exceeding joy, be glory for ever.
Amen."</p>

<p>After an instant's pause their minister began.</p>

<p>"I am not going to speak to the joyful this
Christmas, for they do not need it so much; but I
am going to speak to the downcast, that they may
look forward to this exceeding joy."</p>

<p>Every word might have been meant for John,
and he took it all humbly home to his heart. Never
had his face looked like that before, and when they
came out there were two people happy among the
throng at anyrate.</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis took Agnes's arm, while the rest
lingered for a moment to shake hands with some
friends.</p>

<p>"Agnes," said Miss Headley, "what has come
to John; he looks different?"</p>

<p>Agnes pressed her aunt's arm, and whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104]</a></span>.
"Don't say a word, auntie; but <i>God</i> has been
speaking to him."</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis gazed at her, then, with a wondrous
gladness in her pale face, turned homewards.</p>

<p>They all separated at their different doors. "The
children," as they were called, promising to come
in at the right time.</p>

<p>"No fear of our punctuality to-day, auntie," said
John, smiling.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered his aunt. "I have
known unpunctual people as late on great occasions
as on small."</p>

<p>"Have you? Then we shall prove ourselves, I
hope, to be not unpunctual people."</p>

<p>They ran up their own steps and found Hugh
taking off his coat in the hall.</p>

<p>"Make haste, Hugh," said John; "auntie has
been giving us a lecture on not being late."</p>

<p>"I don't call it much of a lecture," said Alice.
"Aunt Phyllis never lectures."</p>

<p>The girls went upstairs "to make themselves
smart," as Hugh called it, and the two brothers
walked into the dining-room.</p>

<p>John glanced at Hugh, but his face did not
invite conversation, so he took up his new book
and sat down in the window.</p>

<p>"What a smell of beer!" he suddenly exclaimed.
"I wonder what it is?"</p>

<p>Hugh turned scarlet. "I've had a glass," he
said defiantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>You?</i>" said John, too surprised to hide his
grieved dismay.</p>

<p>"There's no sin in that, I hope," answered Hugh
coldly.</p>

<p>John thought a moment. "No&mdash;no, Hugh, I
don't know that there is."</p>

<p>"Then why blame a fellow?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I blamed you; at least, not in
words. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have it out then. Cut me up to your heart's
content."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't for the world, Hugh, dear boy.
What would father have wished you to do?"</p>

<p>"He never bound us."</p>

<p>"I think he did. He never thought we should
wish to take any till we were of an age to decide
for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Don't you call fourteen old enough? Tom
says he calls it absurd to tie us down to an idea."</p>

<p>"Tom knows nothing about it, Hugh."</p>

<p>"How doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Nothing about father's opinions, nor the
principle of the thing."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say father has ever forbidden
me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not in so many words."</p>

<p>"Do you think he would have, if I had waited to
ask him?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"I did not do it as an act of disobedience," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106]</a></span>
Hugh, "and your making it out so is horrid. I
thought I was free to take it if I liked, so long as
I didn't take much."</p>

<p>John sat down by the fire, his face grave and
troubled.</p>

<p>"Hugh," he exclaimed, in a beseeching tone,
"say you won't be tempted to take it again till
father comes home. Oh, Hugh, I would give
everything I possess if you hadn't!"</p>

<p>Hugh was silent. In his present mood he did
not feel inclined to promise.</p>

<p>"Where's the harm?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"Father trusted us not to take it till we were old
enough to judge of its dangers; he said we must
take his judgment till then."</p>

<p>"And how long was that to last?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I was quite willing to leave
it till then. Hugh, what does our text say, as
father is not here?"</p>

<p>John's voice was low, and his face full of feeling.</p>

<p>"I hadn't <i>that</i> to look at out there!" murmured
Hugh.</p>

<p>"No. Oh, Hugh, <i>say</i> you will not again till
they come home?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I wish I had not, now you say so
much about it. John, you won't tell the girls?"</p>

<p>"Not 'the girls;' but I must tell Agnes."</p>

<p>"Then I shan't promise!"</p>

<p>John was staggered for a moment, but after an
instant he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[ 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must not do evil that good may come. I'm
sure you will think better of it, Hugh dear;
and it would be such a comfort to me if you
would."</p>

<p>"At anyrate don't tell Agnes to-day, till I have
had time to think it over. Do as much as that for
me, John."</p>

<p>"I think I may promise that," answered John.
"Hugh, we've had such a beautiful sermon this
morning on, 'Able to keep you from falling;' it
has helped me ever so much."</p>

<p>Then John left the room, and Hugh got up
and walked round the table, and stood in front of
the new frame: he stood long and silently, and
did not move till the others came in.</p>

<p>"You are not dressed," said Alice; "we shall be
late after all!"</p>

<p>"I shan't take long," said Hugh, hurriedly leaving
the room.</p>

<p>"There is time yet," said John; "don't be a
fidget, Alice. Is Minnie going to take her beloved
baby?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Do you suppose I'm such a
bad mamma that I should neglect my children?"</p>

<p>John laughed merrily. "Sometimes mothers
like to show them off; that's one way, you know.
Minnie."</p>

<p>"Well, you're not a mother, so you can't judge,"
answered Minnie saucily.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it! Very well. But if you don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108]</a></span>
mind, I'll play 'father;' and see if you don't find
the tables are turned."</p>

<p>John shook his head so comically that Minnie
hugged her new treasure closer, and retired behind
Agnes, who said:</p>

<p>"You may trust John, Minnie; he will not do
you or Dolly any harm."</p>

<p>"But I don't like being teased," said Minnie,
looking shy; "I'd a great deal rather not, please
John."</p>

<p>Just then Hugh came in, looking very fresh and
nice, and the girls threw on their shawls and went
in next door, bonnetless for once.</p>

<p>As they all crowded up their grandmama's
steps, John felt a twitch at his coat, and Hugh's
voice whispered:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry now, John; and I'll promise."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3><i>CHRISTMAS-DAY.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i107b.png"
width="51" height="110" alt="T" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">hough
it was only three o'clock on this
Christmas-day, the curtains of their grandmother's
pleasant drawing-room were
drawn, the gas was lighted, and everything
was as bright and cosy as possible.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Christmas!" said Hugh,
sitting down on a stool at his aunt's feet.</p>

<p>She smiled, glancing up at her three nieces in
their soft, warm, white dresses, so sweet and simple;
their only ornament, a rosebud on a spray of
maidenhair, which John had procured for them at
Covent Garden late the evening before.</p>

<p>"Now, 'ain't they a pictur'?'" he asked, bending
to kiss his grandmother, though he had seen her
once before that day, for he had run in the first
thing to wish her a happy Christmas.</p>

<p>Their grandmother looked as if she thought so.</p>

<p>"Are you very hungry, dears?" asked Aunt
Phyllis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not particularly," answered Agnes; "we had
some biscuits when we came home."</p>

<p>"Grandmama did not wish to dine before four,
but I am afraid this will seem a long hour to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered John, "we are not so
famished as all that."</p>

<p>"I have brought down some old interesting
books for you boys," said Mrs. Headley, "and
I want Agnes to help me with this piece of work."</p>

<p>She held up a roll of coarse canvas, only just
begun, and asked Agnes to spread it out on the
hearthrug.</p>

<p>Hugh had to get up, which he did with a lazy
groan, while the girls took the different corners
and held them down, Hugh taking a fourth, for
the canvas would roll up again.</p>

<p>"Grandmama, what a lordly piece of work,"
said Agnes; "it will be a long task."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Headley; "but do you
guess what it is?"</p>

<p>John, who was standing behind the rest, made
them laugh by saying:</p>

<p>"I expect it's a mat for a flower vase."</p>

<p>"I expect nothing of the kind," said Hugh,
bending down to examine it; "but I shall not
hazard an opinion till the rest have ventured
to say."</p>

<p>Their grandmother looked amused. "Well?"
she asked, turning to Alice.</p>

<p>"I should say it is a fender-stool."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too coarse," suggested wise little Minnie.</p>

<p>"And much too wide," said John.</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you," laughed Hugh; "for I
believe I'm right."</p>

<p>"As usual," stuck in Alice mischievously.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" said Aunt Phyllis, looking up, "it
is Christmas-day."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Christmas-day is not a coat of steel
mail, auntie," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Steel mail?" she asked, wondering at his
serious tone.</p>

<p>"Doesn't make us quite invulnerable."</p>

<p>"No, no; nothing does that while we have such
a traitor inside us; but it does help us to have
'goodwill to men.'"</p>

<p>Hugh glanced at John&mdash;a glance which was
noticed but not understood by several there.</p>

<p>"But Hugh has not told us after all what he
guesses about grandmama's work," said Aunt
Phyllis.</p>

<p>"It's a mat to put in front of your stand of
flowers."</p>

<p>"You are nearest," said his grandmother, smiling,
"but you are not quite right."</p>

<p>"Then what is it, grandma?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"It is a worked hearthrug for your dear mother
and father, which I hope to get finished by the
time they come home."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Minnie, opening her eyes very
wide, "will it ever get done?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; if I have health and strength," answered
Mrs. Headley.</p>

<p>"I am sure they will like it very much," said
Alice; "but what is Agnes to help in?"</p>

<p>"Only to plan out the pattern at the corners for
me."</p>

<p>"You can buy these things traced out," said
Hugh, "for I've seen them tied up by the corners
in the fancy shops."</p>

<p>"You have not seen <i>these</i> things," said his
grandmother, "they are far too old-fashioned to
suit peoples' notions now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's all like the piece you've done they
haven't got good taste, that's all I can say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley then told Agnes where her difficulty
lay, and she and the two boys were soon
deep in the discussion of how the pattern was
to be "mitred" for the corner, the boys going
down on their knees and showing the greatest
interest.</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis stood looking on with a smile,
happy in seeing four people entirely happy, content
to leave her advice out, if an hour should be passed
in peaceful occupation.</p>

<p>Minnie had turned to her beloved doll, and while
the others were so busy Alice condescended to draw
near her, and was soon playing with it as heartily
as her little sister.</p>

<p>All were surprised when at four o'clock the
dinner bell pealed forth, and John exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[ 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Auntie, we've accomplished it! I really
thought it never was going to come."</p>

<p>"I'm 'going to come' down to dinner," said
Hugh, "so help me roll it up, John, for grandmama's
awfully particular about her work, arn't
you grandma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Headley nodded, well pleased with the
compliment, and then John gave his arm to his
grandmother, and they all went down.</p>

<p>When dinner was over they returned to the
drawing-room, and their aunt produced some new
games which she had been half over London to
procure for them.</p>

<p>They all gathered round the oval table, which
stood in one corner, and quickly took up the idea
of the game, Aunt Phyllis making one of them.
Minnie was too young for what Hugh called its
intricacies, and contented herself with dividing her
attention in a threefold manner between her grandmother,
her doll, and the cat.</p>

<p>After tea they sang together, and the girls played
a duet which they had practised for the occasion,
finishing with some hymns in which all could join.</p>

<p>"This has been a happy Christmas in spite of
their being away," said Alice, sighing deeply, as
they stood round the fire before going home.</p>

<p>"And yet you sigh," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Alice; "I do wish they were
here, and I do wonder how they are getting on;
but all the same, I've had a happy day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right, my dear," said Aunt Phyllis; "I
am sure your dear parents would be glad to know
it."</p>

<p>They stood soberly thinking for a few minutes.
Agnes's eyes resting on John's face with an earnest
look.</p>

<p>"For some things I wish they could know," she
said at last.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Alice; but Agnes noticed that
John and Hugh said nothing.</p>

<p>When they went home they found a fire in the
dining-room, but Agnes proposed they should go
at once to bed.</p>

<p>"May I help you to lock up, instead of John?"
asked Hugh.</p>

<p>Agnes looked surprised, but said "Yes," though
she would much have preferred her usual companion.</p>

<p>The rest wished good night, and went upstairs,
and Agnes and Hugh turned to the lower regions.</p>

<p>When they came back to the warm lighted room,
and Hugh had turned out the gas, he said
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Agnes, I'm afraid you will be very angry with
me, very upset about it, but I never thought it was
so wrong in me, or I am sure I should never have
done it."</p>

<p>"Done what, Hugh?" asked Agnes, trembling
and trying to keep her voice natural.</p>

<p>"I was out with Tom&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Hugh. Don't be afraid to say, dear; only
do tell me quick."</p>

<p>"We were hungry, and we went in and had
some lunch."</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, feeling as if her heart would
stand still, in her fear of she knew not what.</p>

<p>"I was thirsty, and Tom said ginger-beer was
ridiculous on Christmas-day, and he persuaded
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To do what?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"To have a glass of beer," answered Hugh very
low. "I saw no harm in it, as I had not signed;
but John is awfully mad with me, and I've come
to see that it was utterly horrid of me not to
stand up against him."</p>

<p>"So long as you are sorry," said Agnes with a
bitter sigh.</p>

<p>"Agnes, I am worse than sorry; I am dreadfully
ashamed."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear," she answered, rousing herself and
putting her hand round him,"let it only draw
you closer to Him who will forgive us if we
ask."</p>

<p>"I felt I could not look anyone in the face.
Ought I to have told them?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Oh, Hugh dear, it is not so
much the drinking a glass of beer. I would not
wish to condemn anyone for doing that, if it were
all open and above board; though of course I
have long ago made up my mind about it. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116]</a></span>
think where you feel wrong has been that you <i>felt</i>
you were doing what father would disapprove, and
you had not courage to resist."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"So that is what you want to confess to Him,
and ask to have pardoned?"</p>

<p>They were silent, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd scold me awfully," he said at
last.</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Agnes; "you should go to
somebody who has not sinned herself if you want
that."</p>

<p>"But you've never been tempted to go and take
advantage of your parents' being away, and do
exactly as you knew they'd hate you to do."</p>

<p>"No," answered Agnes, "my temptations may
not be the same as yours, and yet I've just as
much to be sorry for when I go to my Lord as you
have."</p>

<p>"<i>Just</i> as much?" asked Hugh, looking in her
face, "do you mean that really, Agnes."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I'm thankful every day of my life,
that these words are written: "Who forgiveth <i>all</i>
thine iniquities."</p>

<p>Hugh put his arms round her.</p>

<p>"Then you forgive me, Agnes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"All my share of it, dear. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother and father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I was not thinking of them! I am sure
they will&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what you mean," said Hugh very softly,
"and I'll go to Him."</p>

<p>He left the room without another word, and
Agnes had to do the rest of her locking-up alone.
Blinded with tears she went to every room, and
then ascended to her own chamber.</p>

<p>Alice and Minnie were in bed, and asleep.</p>

<p>She went and stood at the dressing-table, slowly
unpinning her rose, when her eye fell upon a
Christmas card, which had been given her by Hugh
himself that very morning.</p>

<p>"<i>Jesus</i>: for He shall save His people from their
sins."</p>

<p>She opened her door, crossed the landing, and
tapped at Hugh's.</p>

<p>"Look here!" she said, handing it in, and bending
to kiss him.</p>

<p>He looked at the words, then up in her face,
and there was that in his eyes which made Agnes
say:</p>

<p>"Hugh! you've been to Him?"</p>

<p>And Hugh whispered an earnest "Yes."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3><i>WHERE ONE PUDDING WENT.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i116b.png"
width="51" height="111" alt="A" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">gnes
was one of those girls who loved
to be a true elder sister. Many a time,
when she sat down to tell a story, she
would have preferred to bury herself in
an interesting book, or to go on with a
piece of painting, or delicate needlework;
but by experience she had learned the blessedness
of giving rather than taking pleasure, and her
restless brothers interested for an hour, or Alice's
and Minnie's hearts warmed and stirred up by a
story, was, in her estimation, something accomplished
for her Lord and Master.</p>

<p>So when the day after Christmas-day dawned,
and found them all a little out of sorts, with later
hours, and more excitement than usual, she took
the opportunity to gather them together to hear
the account of where the puddings went, and how
they were received.</p>

<p>John threw himself into an arm-chair with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119]</a></span>
yawn, Hugh stretched himself on the sofa with his
face downwards, while Alice and Minnie sat on the
hearthrug resting their heads against her knee.</p>

<p>Agnes was not offended at her brothers' positions,
knowing that their fatigued dulness meant no
disrespect to her, and would soon change to interest
in her narration when once she began.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Now don't, Hugh, I am going to begin; but I
must have time to collect my thoughts."</p>

<p>"I shall be asleep then," he answered. "Agnes,
why do you choose such a morning to tell us? we
can't do justice to you."</p>

<p>For answer, Agnes only smiled and began.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"'Bother the children, they are in my way from
morning to night! Not a bit of peace. And how
I'm to do to-morrow I don't know any more than
nobody!'</p>

<p>"The words were spoken by a woman who
looked inexpressibly worried and tired. The room
was small, the children were many, the fire was
poor, and the cold was severe. As she spoke she
pushed one child into one corner, another into
another; she hustled a big clumsy boy away from
the little fire, and she swept down some poor little
playthings off the table on to the floor with a
sharp rattle which betokened a breakage of a toy,
such as it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"A bitter cry from a little pale boy, to whom
this small plate had belonged, arrested the mother's
attention for a moment, but only to add to her
exasperation.</p>

<p>"'Stop yer crying,' she exclaimed, 'or I'll stop
yer!' and the little fellow swallowed down his
tears as best he might, and wiped the rest on his
sleeve, as he bent down to gather his little sticks
together, picking up the remains of his one doll's
plate, which had enabled him to have imaginary
dinners and teas in his play for many a day.</p>

<p>"The children saw that they had better make
themselves scarce, and though a keen east wind
and sleet raged outside on this Christmas-eve,
most of them turned out into the narrow street
till tea should be ready.</p>

<p>"When, through the uncurtained window, they
could see from their mother's movements that they
might venture in, they gladly once more entered
the little untidy room.</p>

<p>"Their mother had cut them each two slices of
bread and dripping, and to this they sat down
with ravenous appetites. Alas! much too soon
were the pieces demolished, and the crumbs
picked up off the comfortless bare table.</p>

<p>"'Ain't there any more?' asked the elder boy.</p>

<p>"'No, there ain't,' said his mother sharply; all
the more sharply that she would have given
anything to have been able to say yes instead of
no.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"The big boy looked disappointed enough, and
shuffled his feet about discontentedly.</p>

<p>"'What have yer got for dinner to-morrow?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'Usual fare,' said his mother; 'there ain't nothing
but bread now-a-days, and not too much of that.'</p>

<p>"An ominous silence brooded over the only half-satisfied
children, and the mother rocked the baby
to and fro with a look on her face which was both
sad and hopeless.</p>

<p>"'Why don't we have something nice, even if
father's work is short? When it's plenty I should
ha' thought we might ha' saved a bit,' grumbled
the eldest.</p>

<p>"'Save!' exclaimed the poor mother, 'why, if
we've got it, you know ye eat it, and if we ain't
got it, we go without.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I don't like not having 'nuff to eat,' said
the big boy vexedly. 'I brings home all I earns,
and it ain't fair.'</p>

<p>"'And how much have you earned <i>this</i> week?'
asked his mother crossly.</p>

<p>"'Well, look at this weather, for yer,' answered
he; 'how can us earn when no one won't build at
any price?'</p>

<p>"'Then shut up,' answered the tired mother,
'and wait for better times.'</p>

<p>"She rose, and prepared to put the baby to bed.
The eldest little girl washed up the few cups, while
the boys began an undertoned game at tickling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122]</a></span>
each other, which soon resulted in laughter and
subdued noise. This brought down on them a
sharp reprimand from their mother, and finally a
box on the ears all round.</p>

<p>"Somewhat quieted, but in no good humour, they
retired into a corner, and proceeded to cut up
some pieces of wood which their brother's trade
supplied them with. They could muster but one
knife between them, but a boy cautiously crept to
the cupboard and abstracted one belonging to the
housekeeping, the rest watching their mother's
head lest she should discover the act of disobedience;
for such it was in this little home,
where a lost knife would be a serious misfortune.</p>

<p>"At last the baby was carried upstairs for the
night, and the mother descended with her hands
free for the time.</p>

<p>"'Off to bed you go,' she said to the next three,
who were crowding over the little fire.</p>

<p>"There was no objection for once, but just as the
little girl of ten years old was taking the lamp to
light them to bed a knock came at the door and
startled them all.</p>

<p>"The girl set down the light and opened the
door.</p>

<p>"'Why if it ain't Miss Agnes Headley;' said the
mother. 'Come in, miss, do.'</p>

<p>"'No thank you, I have only come to bring you
a little present for Christmas, and I hope you will
have a happy day,' said Miss Headley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[ 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"The big boy jumped up in a moment, and took
it from her, with a 'thank ye, miss,' which meant
a great deal; but Miss Headley did not wait, and
they closed the door from the bitter wind, while
all crowded round the table in anxious expectation.</p>

<p>"At the top of the parcel was an immense
Christmas pudding, of a size to satisfy the appetites
of even that numerous party. On it was pinned a
paper with these words written: 'This pudding is
cooked, but must be boiled for an hour and a half
to warm it through. The cloth is for you.'</p>

<p>"A shout of pleasure was forced from the
delighted family as they viewed their promised
treat.</p>

<p>"Under the pudding, which had been wrapped up
in a whole newspaper, lay an old jacket, a comforter,
a worn pair of trousers, and a frock for the
girl of ten. Last of all was a piece of stout
paper on which someone (Hugh Headley I think)
had painted these words: 'Come unto Me, all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest.'</p>

<p>"On the back of this was written, 'Please pin
this up on the wall for a Christmas text.'</p>

<p>"The eldest boy produced two or three nails, and
had put it over the mantelshelf before they could
say a word, and then, as the mother reminded them
the pudding would come all the sooner for going
to bed, they took her advice and disappeared, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124]</a></span>
but the big boy, who hung behind to say, 'I'm
mortal hungry, mother, I suppose you ain't got a
crust?'</p>

<p>"Half an hour before she would have answered
'no' hastily enough, but there were tears in her
eyes as she handed him the bit of bread which
was to have served for her supper, as she said:</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry, boy, it's all so short, but you know
what yer boots cost last week, and you can't have
everything.'</p>

<p>"'Good-night, mother,' he said, stooping to
give her a rough kiss; 'but it <i>is</i> hard to be
hungry.'</p>

<p>"When the little door had closed upon her
children the mother sat down in a chair with her
hands drooping in her lap. Then she wiped away
the unwonted tears as she looked round at the
package on the table, and then back at the bright
text in front of her. It was that text which had
softened her heart, and made her cry. It was
that text which had suddenly reminded her of old
days when she had thought more of these things
than she did now.</p>

<p>"'Come unto Me, all ye that are heavy laden.'</p>

<p>"The tired, worried, over-wrought mother buried
her face in her hands. Long she sat and wept.</p>

<p>"'I thought He had forgotten me,' she whispered.
And then she rose up and made the room ready
for the father, repeating softly to herself all the
while, 'I will give you rest, I will give you rest.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[ 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"After some time, much later than she had
expected, the well-known footstep was heard at
the door.</p>

<p>"The mother knew before the father entered
that the foot bore a more cheerful sound than
had been of late, and his words corroborated her
thought.</p>

<p>"'Well, wife, so here you are all alone! Why,
so they're all gone to roost!'</p>

<p>"To get the sooner to Christmas-day," answered
the mother, her eyes falling, as his did, on the
table scattered over with the things they had
received.</p>

<p>"They needed very little explanation, and meanwhile
the father was fumbling in his pocket for
something, which he now laid on the table by his
wife.</p>

<p>"'That's my share for to-morrow,' he said. 'I
stayed out all these hours on the chance of a job,
and at last I got one. A gentleman couldn't get a
cab nohow, everything's engaged on this wet night,
to say nought of its being Christmas; so I carried
his heavy portmanteau nigh on four miles, and he
gave me this half-crown. And now I want my
supper, wife.'</p>

<p>"The mother rose quickly and stirred the little fire.
Already the kettle boiled, and the cup was set on
the table with perhaps, unusual care. But the
fare was indeed scant&mdash;a piece of bread cut off
for the father before she had begun for the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126]</a></span>
and a bit of dripping. Meanwhile she was hastily
putting on bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>"'Where to?' asked he, surprised; 'there ain't
no hurry to get a bit of meat. The butchers will
be open for hours yet; so sit still for once.'</p>

<p>"'I shan't be a minute,' she said, and was gone
before he could object.</p>

<p>"It was not much more ere she appeared again,
bringing in her hand a large loaf, and a herring
which she immediately placed on the fire, while
she cut some fresh slices of the day-old bread, with
a heart filled with pleasure that she had it to give
him.</p>

<p>"'I've been looking at yon words,' he said, 'and
they seem to say to me as we haven't thought so
much of Him as we should, eh, old woman? We
couldn't have a better day nor to-morrow to begin,
eh?'</p>

<p>"'I've begun to-night,' she said. 'I've forgot
Him lately, but He ain't forgot me!'"</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Alice looked up now, as Agnes finished her
narration, and said wonderingly, "I can't think how
you know it, Agnes."</p>

<p>"I will not keep you in suspense then," she
answered. "Mrs. Freeman came round early on
Christmas-day to thank us for the things, and in a
few simple words explained her despair and her
comfort, and how the words, 'Come unto <i>Me</i>,' had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127]</a></span>
put a new life before her, a life of rest and peace,
even in the midst of outward turmoil. Our little
effort for her, you see, did even more than we could
have hoped."</p>

<p>"Have you any more stories?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Not to-day. Minnie and I saw other things,
but you will have to wait for those till we have
another opportunity."</p>

<h3><i>THE RAG CUSHION</i>.</h3>

<img src="images/i126b.png"
width="74" height="118" alt="W" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">ell,
Agnes?" said John, one sombre
afternoon soon after Christmas, as the
brothers and sisters gathered round
the fire with a heap of nuts each,
which they intended to enjoy.</p>

<p>"Well?" echoed Agnes.</p>

<p>"Now for the stories of the other puddings."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Agnes; "to resume, then.</p>

<hr style="width: 80%;" />

<p>"After we had left Mrs. Freeman's door, Minnie
and I went a little further up the street. We were
not sorry, I assure you, to get rid of our first heavy
parcel, for our arms ached with it. At last, in the
wind, and rain, and darkness, we found the house
where Mrs. Hales has her home. This, you must
know, consists of one little stuffy room on the
second floor.</p>

<p>"We groped our way up the dark staircase, and,
after some fumbling, we found the door of the
back room and knocked at it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"A feeble voice bade us 'Come in,' and we
found ourselves in the presence of the dear old
woman.</p>

<p>"'Well, my dear,' she said, holding out her thin
hand, 'so you've come, like a Christmas blessing,
to see me.'</p>

<p>"We sat down by her, Minnie holding the
parcel in her lap. I was quite used, as you know,
to her ways, so let her take her own plan, as on
other days. She was seated in a high-backed
chair, with an old shawl tucked behind her head as
a support, and her feet resting on a small wooden
box in front of the very tiniest fire you ever did
see.</p>

<p>"She seemed very silent after the first greeting;
so, as Minnie was most impatient to open our
package, I asked her if she felt equal to looking at
what we had brought for her.</p>

<p>"She assented, and Minnie's little eager fingers
soon untied the strings, and presented your bright
cushion, John and Hugh.</p>

<p>"Her poor pale face smiled when she saw it, and
she asked me to draw out the old shawl, and
replace it by the cushion.</p>

<p>"'And now the shawl will do for my knees,' she
said, 'which do feel the cold very much.'</p>

<p>"'And here is a little Christmas pudding for
you, and a tin of groats, and a trifle to buy some
coals with, and a text.'</p>

<p>"'My dear,' she said, 'you are very loving, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130]</a></span>
the Lord is very loving, and He has sent me just
what I wanted most, and that's the way with the
Lord, my dear. He knows about us&mdash;just all
about us. He knows my head has been weary
enough without a cushion; He knows my knees
have been cold; He knows I wanted some gruel;
and when He brings me near enough to Him to say
from my heart&mdash;truly, my dear, from my very heart&mdash;"Dear
Lord, I'm willing to wait Thy time, Thou
knowest best for me"&mdash;then, my dear, He lovingly
sends you round (you don't mind my saying <i>He</i>
sent you, my dear) with just the very things of all
others I wanted. He's a <i>dear</i> Lord.'</p>

<p>"There were tears on her wrinkled cheeks as
she laid her hand on Minnie's little one, which
rested on her knee.</p>

<p>"'Here's the text,' said Minnie, holding up the
one you painted for her, John.</p>

<p>"'My God shall supply all your need, according
to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, my dear,' she continued, 'and it isn't only
our needs for this world. We are very apt to think,
all of us, that it means food, and clothes, and fire;
but it don't, my dear&mdash;not only that&mdash;it's that He
supplies <i>everything</i>&mdash;He supplies grace to bear,
patience to wait, faith to trust, and hope to look
forward to the time when we shall be with Him for
ever.'</p>

<p>"She looked up now, beyond the walls of the
little room, beyond the dingy paper, on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[ 131]</a></span>
everlasting Home which is coming to all who wait
for Him.</p>

<p>"When she brought her mind back, as it were,
from these thoughts, I asked her if she could bear
two or three nails driven in somewhere. She
looked a little surprised, but I produced Hugh's
little hammer, and soon had put her text where
she could see it without turning her poor head.
Then I drew forth from the bottom of the parcel
the unworn end of our old wool door-mat, and with
her permission nailed it securely to the top of her
wooden footstool, and when we had seen her with
great satisfaction place her feet upon it again, we
left her, while we retraced our steps homewards, the
Christmas bells ringing in my ears all the way with
these words borne upon them, 'My God shall supply
all your need&mdash;all your need&mdash;all your need.'"</p>

<p>"Who thought of the piece of old mat for her
stool?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"I think I did," said Agnes. "I was reading to
her one day, when I noticed how thin her shoes
were, and how comfortless the old box looked. But
she never repines; though she has only that little
miserable room, which she never leaves, she says
not a word, but is always full of thanksgiving for
her many mercies."</p>

<p>"I believe the less people have the more grateful
they are," said Alice.</p>

<p>"I don't see that at all!" exclaimed Hugh. While
Agnes said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! that isn't it, Alice. But sometimes,
when people lose all earthly possessions, they are
brought to seek that great heavenly possession
which makes up for every other loss. That's what
it is."</p>

<p>"Then the humdrum people who are just comfortable
don't get such a good chance as the poor
ones, according to you, Agnes," Hugh observed.</p>

<p>She shook her head, smiling. "Sometimes they
have to lose something they value very much
before they can be brought to receive the great
possession."</p>

<p>"What sort of thing?" asked Hugh quickly.</p>

<p>"I do not know," answered Agnes thoughtfully.
"Each one of us values some one thing more than
another; and if we love it better than Him, it will
have to go."</p>

<p>"But what, Agnes? Can't you say the kind of
things?"</p>

<p>"Our own way sometimes," she answered slowly,
"that's often hardest of all; at least to some
people."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hugh, laughing a little; "some of us
always do think we know best."</p>

<p>At this moment a diversion occurred.</p>

<p>"You're wanted in the drawing-room, Master
Hugh," said the maid; "there's the same young
gentleman that came on Christmas-day, and his
sister."</p>

<p>Hugh turned very red, and was hastening away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133]</a></span>
when he came back to say, "Agnes, come and help
a fellow, will you?"</p>

<p>Agnes followed him upstairs, wondering what
they had come for.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Miss Headley," said the young
lady, bending, but not offering her hand. "My
brother asked me to come and intercede with you
to allow your young people to join our little party
next week?"</p>

<p>"I?" echoed Agnes, surprised. "I really did
not know they were asked. Hugh, did you forget
to tell me?"</p>

<p>Agnes felt uncomfortable, and wished Hugh had
explained before they came up.</p>

<p>"Well, no," answered Hugh; "I told Tom we
couldn't come."</p>

<p>"He said," answered Miss Radnor, "that he was
sure his sister would not approve."</p>

<p>"It would have been better for Hugh to have
asked me," answered Agnes; "but now will you
kindly tell me what it is you wish?"</p>

<p>Miss Radnor looked as if it were all a great bore,
but answered politely:</p>

<p>"Tom has set his heart on having Hugh and his
two younger sisters to his party next week. Will
you allow them to come? I believe they are to
refer to you, as their parents are away."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Agnes, hesitating
a little, "you are very kind, but I believe my father
would prefer our declining."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why?" asked the girl; "I really cannot
take no for an answer."</p>

<p>"I should not feel at liberty to make any fresh
acquaintances while our parents are away."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous! How can a schoolfellow be
a fresh acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to seem discourteous," said Agnes
gently; "but I know my parents' feelings on these
subjects, and must beg you to excuse us till their
return."</p>

<p>"Oh, just as you like, <i>of course</i>," said the girl,
rising; "I don't think we should have done your
charge any harm."</p>

<p>"I am sure you would not mean to," answered
Agnes gravely&mdash;so gravely that Miss Radnor
flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Are we such undesirable acquaintances?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean that," answered Agnes, raising
her eyes steadily, "but it is so difficult in these
days to keep in the path&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What path?" she asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"The narrow path that leadeth to Life," Agnes
answered very low. "Do not be vexed with me,
we are strangers, and may never meet again; but
we do want to keep in that, cost what it may."</p>

<p>Miss Radnor laughed haughtily. "I had no idea
you were so religious!" she exclaimed. "I beg
your pardon for coming; good-day."</p>

<p>With that she swept out of the room, followed
by Tom, who only gave Hugh a passing grimace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135]</a></span>
which Hugh was at a loss to interpret. Did it
mean sympathy with him, or with his sister?</p>

<p>"Hugh," said Agnes, "you should have told me."</p>

<p>"I never thought there would be another word.
What a hateful girl, Agnes."</p>

<p>"I do not suppose she is; though I can't say I
admired her."</p>

<p>"She looked round on all our things as though
they were dirt!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. But I daresay she is richer than we
are."</p>

<p>"Oceans! They have twice as big a house."</p>

<p>"And half as big hearts perhaps," laughed
Agnes. "Oh, Hugh, I pity that poor Tom."</p>

<p>"So do I, now I see what sort of a sister he's
got. But he doesn't think her bad; he told me
she was 'a stunner.'"</p>

<p>"I daresay. Well dear, are you satisfied with
what I said? I wish I had said it better."</p>

<p>Hugh kissed her. "I couldn't have had half the
courage you had," he answered; "and they'll be
all the better for it some day, depend upon it.
Don't look downhearted, you're a dear old girl."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3><i>THE LAST PUDDING.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i134b.png"

and her brothers and sisters ran
down the steps of their London home,
one frosty morning towards the end of
the holidays, and turned their steps
toward Regent's Park. While the roar
of omnibuses was for ever in their ears
there could be little talking, but when they began
to find quieter streets they gathered close to Agnes,
begging for "a story." This was a usual custom
with them, and Agnes quickly responded by
beginning cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have never had the account of
our other visit on Christmas-eve; so I must begin
where I left off last time.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"When Minnie and I reached home, with the
bells ringing the refrain of peace and contentment,
we just came in to warm our fingers, and then
started forth again on our last errand. This time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[ 137]</a></span>
our parcel was even heavier than before, and we
were very glad when we reached the house to
which our steps were bound.</p>

<p>"House it was not, being just a large room over
a stable, where, as you know, Martha, our former
housemaid, lives, since she married Jim, the cabman.</p>

<p>"We picked our way as well as we could over
the stones, slippery and wet with mud, and at last
came to the door leading to the staircase which
runs up by the side of the coach-house. We found
it ajar, and as the bell was broken we made our
way up in the darkness. All was pitchy black,
but a baby wailing above told us there must
be somebody within. We found the door of the
room at the top, and knocked. A voice, sharp
and quick, which I should hardly have known for
Martha's soft one, answered, 'What do you want?'
and on this invitation we entered.</p>

<p>"No light was in the room, but the gas-lamp
of the yard shed flickering and uncertain gleams
through the window into the barest and untidiest
of chambers.</p>

<p>"We could see, as our eyes became used to the
dim light, that Martha was seated near the empty
grate, holding the baby in her lap, while three little
mites were huddled up against her knees on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Desolate indeed everything seemed.</p>

<p>"'Why, Martha,' said I, 'are you all in the dark?
Shall I find a light for you?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Is it you, Miss Agnes?' said Martha, in somewhat
of her old tone of respect. 'I beg your
pardon, miss, but I'm that harassed with all my
troubles, that I don't rightly know what I'm doing.'</p>

<p>"'What is it?' asked I, advancing. 'What has
come to you?'</p>

<p>"'Everything bad,' she moaned, in the saddest
of tones. 'You know I would marry Jim, though
Mrs. Headley told me he was not a steady man,
and too soon I've found her words true; we've
been going on from bad to worse, till one by one all
my nice clothes went, then our bits of furniture, and
now we haven't a morsel to eat, nor a scrap of fire,
nor an end of candle!'</p>

<p>"Too utterly miserable to hide her woe under
her usual mask of reserve, and encouraged by the
darkness, she continued in a voice husky and dry
with suppressed grief:</p>

<p>"'And it's all through drink! He used to be
kind to me; but that's long past. Then, when he
missed the things in the house, he used to ask
angrily for them, and when I told him we couldn't
starve, and if he spent the money on drink we
couldn't have food, then he'd up and beat me.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, hush!' I whispered, 'don't let the little
ones hear you say so.'</p>

<p>"'I don't care,' she answered, 'they've seen it
often enough, and nothing matters now; here's my
baby, my only boy, dying of hunger!'</p>

<p>"I had sat hitherto spell-bound by her words, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139]</a></span>
now I started to my feet. 'Dying!' I said, 'What
can I get quickest?'</p>

<p>"'Nought'll save him now,' she said, without a
shade of hope in her voice; 'but if you can get
him a drop of milk, it would ease me to think he
hadn't died hungry.'</p>

<p>"There was a sob now in her tearless voice; but
not stopping to say a word, I hastily found the
door, and descended the steps.</p>

<p>"You may be sure it was not long before I had
got a little milk in a can from a neighbouring
shop, and a bit of candle which the woman lent
me at my earnest request, and I ran back with
them as fast as my feet could carry me.</p>

<p>"Happily a match was forthcoming, and the
milk was soon put to the baby's lips. He was
about eight months old, but was shrunken up to
skin and bone. He took with great difficulty a
little of the milk, and then nestled again against
his mother.</p>

<p>"'Why didn't you tell us?' I asked, forced to
say the words.</p>

<p>"'I couldn't; there, I couldn't, miss. I've never
begged yet, and I can't begin. I can die, and they
can die, but I can't beg.'</p>

<p>"'Oh dear, Martha!' I said, my voice choked
with tears, 'if we'd only known!'</p>

<p>"She wept now, hanging her head over the
baby with despairing sobs.</p>

<p>"'But aren't you all hungry?' I said suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"She nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Again I flew out, leaving poor little scared
Minnie sitting there; and hurrying off to a baker's,
bought a stale loaf, and hastened back, ordering
on my way a little coal and wood.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes Minnie and I had drawn the
shivering little mites from their mother's knees,
and had set them near the fireplace, in which I
hoped there would soon be a blaze, and had given
them some slices of bread, while I handed a piece
to poor broken-hearted Martha.</p>

<p>"Then the coals came lumbering up the stairs,
and, thanks to mother's teaching, Minnie and I
quickly built up a warm little fire, and we had
time to look round. Then our eyes fell on the
parcel. We opened it with all speed, and arrayed
the little cold mortals in the old clothes we had
brought, and when the pudding was laid aside for
another time, I drew out our third text, that it too
might carry its message to these sad hearts: 'Ye
know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became
poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.'</p>

<p>"'Rich!' said Martha, with a hoarse laugh,
reading the words in spite of herself with her dim
eyes, as I pinned them up, 'it's little riches I shall
ever see!'</p>

<p>"'But what about the baby? If he should die
now, will he be poor then, do you think?' I asked
softly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"She moaned as she hugged him tighter. 'I
love him more than anything in this world, or out
of it,' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"'And perhaps&mdash;oh, Martha, I don't know&mdash;but
perhaps God loved you too well to let you. You
would rather be rich with him there, some day, for
ever, than just keep him a little while here?'</p>

<p>"She shook her head; but while she rocked
him in her arms, her eyes were fastened on the
paper before her, and her pale lips repeated, 'He
became poor, He became poor, that ye through
His poverty might be rich.'</p>

<p>"We stopped a little while longer, till we had
seen the poor little dears cuddled together asleep
under their mother's only remaining shawl, and with
a promise of sending round the first thing in the
morning, and that I thought I knew of some work
which I might get for her, Minnie and I came
away, too sad at heart to say a word to each other.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"But when I laid down that night in our warm
snug bed, Minnie, who was awake, whispered to
me softly, 'It was kind of Him to become poor
for us, Agnes, wasn't it? For what comfort could
we give her if He hadn't?'</p>

<p>"And I thought so too, and could not but thank
Him over again before I slept for His love in
taking our flesh and bearing our sorrows, that we
might some day share His glory."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3><i>NEW YEAR'S EVE</i>.</h3>

<img src="images/i140b.png"
width="51" height="117" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap"> call
it extremely selfish of you and
John to have had this secret all this
time, and never to have told us,"said
Hugh, on the morning before New Year's
Day, as they all sat at breakfast.</p>

<p>Agnes looked up over the "cosy," a
surprised hurt look overshadowing the brightness
of her face.</p>

<p>"You do not <i>really</i> think it unkind, Hugh?" she
asked; "you are only trying to tease me."</p>

<p>"I'm not joking at all," answered Hugh, dropping
his eyes so as not to meet her beseeching ones.
"For you and John to have kept this to yourself
all this time is exceedingly selfish."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>I</i> didn't know," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Alice.</p>

<p>"That's different!" exclaimed Hugh hastily;
"you're <i>girls</i>; but I'm only two years younger
than John, and I don't see any reason why you
should not have told me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was no reason," said Agnes gently,
"except just this: Mother thought that it would
be a little pleasure for New Year's Eve, and a
secret that is told to everyone is no secret."</p>

<p>"But I might have been told; I should not
have let it out like a girl."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Alice, her eyes sparkling with
displeasure; "and so because we are girls we are
not to be trusted with anything, while because you
are boys&mdash;for no other reason&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, Agnes's face stopped her, and then
her eyes turned to John's, and she noticed that his
were fixed earnestly on the text, which was just
touched by the morning sunshine, as it crept silently
along the wall&mdash;</p>

<p class="altfont">"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John," she said softly; "I quite forgot."</p>

<p>And then they all noticed that John had not
forgotten.</p>

<p>At Hugh's first angry word, just as he was
turning to answer, the light on the text caught his
attention, and his promise to Agnes flashed across
him; his promise that while their parents were
away he would try with might and main to refrain
from quarrelling with his brother.</p>

<p>There was a few moments' silence, while each
of the five assembled there had time to remember
their resolves, and to ask for strength to keep
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Alice spoke. "Do you mind telling us.
Agnes, what you are going to do then?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know my morning Sunday-school
class that I have given up to another teacher while
mother is away?"</p>

<p>Alice nodded.</p>

<p>"Mother thought it would be nice if we asked
them to tea to-day, and hoped it would keep them
together better; and then John and I have been
devising how we could please them."</p>

<p>"Did you think of a Christmas-tree?" asked
Hugh eagerly.</p>

<p>Agnes shook her head. "It was of no use
thinking of it; we hadn't money enough. No,
we thought of games; only the boys are apt to
get rough, and without mother and father it seemed
a great undertaking."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Alice; "for don't you remember
what a dreadful noise they made one year when
we had them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John; "so, as I was passing
along the Strand the day after father went to
America, I noticed 'magic-lanterns for school treats,'
posted up very large in a window, and it gave me
the idea of using mine for our little treat, and
hiring a few more slides to make it last longer."</p>

<p>"Yes, we haven't so very many slides," said
Minnie, considering.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," answered John; "but at anyrate
two dozen more will be an advantage."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[ 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"And after the magic-lantern is over?" asked
Alice.</p>

<p>"Agnes is going to talk to them, or tell them a
story, and after that they'll have an orange."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Minnie, "I shall like that."</p>

<p>"Which," asked Hugh, "the 'talk,' or the 'story,'
or the 'orange'?"</p>

<p>Minnie blushed, but after the late little breeze
determined not to be vexed, and answered, "You
know perfectly well what I meant, Hugh; so it's
no good trying to make out anything else."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to do anything to-day.
Agnes?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," exclaimed Agnes; "I have a
perfect list of things to be done. Cakes to be
made by Alice; room to be got ready by Hugh;
chairs brought from everywhere, seats devised,
flowers arranged&mdash;there, I can't tell you all till we
are in it."</p>

<p>"And is there anything for me to do?" asked
Minnie, getting up and coming round to lean
against her sister's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want you to be willing to run messages
all day long, and never to mind how often Alice
sends you upstairs, or Hugh sends you downstairs,
but to have feet of love for to-day."</p>

<p>"All right," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"And then for pleasant things, between whiles,
you shall go to buy the oranges, and some buns,
and some gingerbread nuts, and so on, and we'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[ 146]</a></span>
have I hope as happy a day as any since they
went away."</p>

<p>As Agnes turned at the door to give a parting
direction, Hugh put his arm round her and said
humbly:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry I was so stupid, Agnes&mdash;so
wrong&mdash;but I'm for ever forgetting."</p>

<p>And Agnes said, "I'm sorry too, Hugh, that we
made a secret of it, for I see now it would have
been nicer for you to have known; but I didn't
mean to be unkind."</p>

<p>After that they worked on happily together all
the morning, though Hugh felt a twinge whenever
any one remarked, as Minnie and Alice were apt to
do all day, "How funny it seems not to have
known."</p>

<p>"It's the last secret I'll have, John, that I can
help," said Agnes to him when they were left alone
for a few minutes, and were busy pinning up the
sheet.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John, reaching down from the
top of the steps, where he was astride, and taking
the corner from her outstretched arm, "Yes, Agnes.
I don't believe in secrets."</p>

<p>"Nor I," answered Agnes, "I have seen it before,
and it will this time be a lesson to me."</p>

<p>"But we didn't quarrel over it, exactly."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but we might have if you had not
remembered in time. I do not mean that I defend
Hugh for being so cross over it, but I see once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[ 147]</a></span>
more that nobody likes to have things kept and
then given all of a heap."</p>

<p>"You are very lucid."</p>

<p>"Well," she answered, laughing and blushing.
"I remember on my seventeenth birthday you all
thought it would be nice to give me my presents at
tea, and so they were kept all day, and it was a
wretched birthday."</p>

<p>John was descending the ladder. "I never
knew that," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not worth remembering," said Agnes;
"I only thought of it as an illustration. It was
not that I cared so much about the presents, you
know, John, it was because everything seemed incomplete.
After all I had a much better present
than I ever dreamed of, for father gave me my
dear little watch."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," said John. "Now, Agnes,
for the other end; that hangs very straight, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Nicely. This long curtain-pole is a fine idea
for magic-lantern exhibitions."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad you thought of it. Agnes, how
do you like being left to ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Agnes decidedly.</p>

<p>"Are we better or worse than you expected?"</p>

<p>"I am worse&mdash;you are better," she answered,
laughing a little; but it was as near a sob as a
laugh.</p>

<p>"How?" asked John earnestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I mean that in one way, and not in
another. I think I expected we should all be
more perfect than we are."</p>

<p>"You did not expect me to break my promise,
for instance?" asked John gravely.</p>

<p>"I hardly think you did. Oh no, John, you have
been better in every way than I could have hoped,
and <i>I</i> have been worse!"</p>

<p>"I don't see it," he answered fondly.</p>

<p>"But I do; I trusted in myself too much."</p>

<p>"We all do. Agnes, I'm inclined to think this
being left to ourselves will turn out for our good."</p>

<p>"I am sure I hope so."</p>

<p>"Don't be desponding. Look at Hugh! Who
ever heard him acknowledge himself in the wrong
before? and yet just now, you know what he said to
you? He would not have done that a month ago."</p>

<p>Agnes looked up. "Do you think so?" she said.
"Oh, John, what a comforter you are."</p>

<p>"Then cheer up. Are you not doing what He
would have you to do?"</p>

<p>"I try to."</p>

<p>"Then thank Him," said her brother cheerfully,
"and take courage."</p>

<p>All was in readiness by the hour fixed for the
arrival of their little guests, and very punctually to
it, in fact a quarter of an hour before five o'clock.
Minnie, who was always the one to watch at the
window, announced that two of them were loitering
about outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[ 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"How cold they'll be," she said pitifully.</p>

<p>"Not they," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"I should be," answered Minnie.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you</i>! but these poor little mites are used
to be in the streets all day."</p>

<p>"So they are. But I wonder if Agnes will let
me bring them in?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered John, who came in at that
moment, "wait till it strikes five; as Hugh says,
they are used to it."</p>

<p>Before the hand was on the hour, twelve or
fourteen children crowded up the steps, and one of
them, the boldest of the party, ventured to give a
single 'dab' at the door, which brought Hugh to
open it; and then began the disrobing, which
orderly John had promised to superintend.</p>

<p>They were ushered into the dining-room, where
tea was laid all ready, and it did not take them
long to sit down and begin.</p>

<p>After all were satisfied, the table was pushed
back into a corner, and in a few moments John and
Hugh packed the children round the room so that
all could see well, Minnie squeezing herself into a
little corner by the sheet, where she would not
have at all a good view, remarking, "Of course it
does not matter a bit about <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>John smiled, but did not see where he could put
her better, and, after all, was it not her little offering
of love to her Master?</p>

<p>When it was all over, and the views had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150]</a></span>
seen, and the story told, and the oranges eaten, and
the happy children gone, Hugh said:</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"So did everyone, I think," remarked Alice.</p>

<p>"In spite of its having been a secret," he went
on, smiling; "but another time (though I oughtn't
to have been cross over it), if you want to give a
fellow pleasure, don't surprise him."</p>

<p>"We will not," said Agnes, glad to see the
twinkle in Hugh's eye.</p>

<p>And then tired-out they hastily ate some supper
and hurried off to bed, too fatigued to fulfil their
intention of sitting up to see the year out.</p>

<p>"I'll set the alarum and wake you all," said
John.</p>

<p>So the alarum was set, and they went to bed in
peaceful anticipations of waking just in time.</p>

<p>By-and-by it went off with a peal which always
startled him in spite of his determination, and out
John sprang and struck a match.</p>

<p>"Hugh, get up," he called, "it is ten minutes to&mdash;why
it is ten minutes <i>past</i> twelve, and no good
at all!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3><i>WORRIED.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i149b.png"
width="53" height="113" alt="A" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">gnes,
my child, being left in charge does
not agree with you."</p>

<p>"Why, auntie?"</p>

<p>"Your mother will find but a shadow
of the rosy girl she left behind her."</p>

<p>Agnes sighed, and then got up and
looked in the glass.</p>

<p>"I do not see that I am different," she said, after
a moment's contemplation.</p>

<p>"No, I daresay you would not notice it in yourself
from day to day. But you have nothing
special to trouble you, my dear, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, auntie. But I had no idea the
anxiety of a family would be so great."</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis smiled a sweet placid smile, which
proceeded from a heart at rest after storms.</p>

<p>"You ought not to be carrying your own burdens
though, dear child," she said softly.</p>

<p>Agnes had seated herself at her aunt's feet, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152]</a></span>
the wide stool which the children said was made
on purpose for them to share, and now looked up
in her aunt's face with tearful eyes.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "that is often what grieves me.
I am afraid, auntie, I thought I should be <i>sure</i> to
get on, and trusted in my own cleverness too
much, and then when difficulties come I get downhearted."</p>

<p>"And do you try the remedy of taking everything
to your Lord directly it comes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but things are so difficult to decide, and I
am so disappointed in myself."</p>

<p>"You thought you were so much stronger than
you find yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and John looks up to me, and I hoped I
should be a help to him; and instead I've done
nothing but find out that I'm no good at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are rather tired of gazing in the
looking-glass, then?" said Aunt Phyllis quaintly.</p>

<p>"Auntie?"</p>

<p>"I'd look towards the sky next, if I were you!"
she added, smiling, as she got up to go and fetch
some work.</p>

<p>Agnes was left alone; and she glanced first in
the fire, and then at the mirror above her head,
and then her eyes wandered to the window.</p>

<p>"I see!" she exclaimed, a light breaking over
her downcast face; "I'm to look off to Jesus;
that's what auntie means!"</p>

<p>That morning Agnes had passed through some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[ 153]</a></span>
of those little difficulties which so often arise in
daily life.</p>

<p>First the housemaid had accosted her with the
ominous words, "Please, miss, could I speak to
you?" and had thereupon given her a month's
notice.</p>

<p>On her pressing for a reason the maid had said,
with many blushes, that she was intending to be
married directly her time was up.</p>

<p>"But can you not wait till mother comes home?"
pleaded Agnes. "I trust she will be home in
March; that would be only another month. Could
you not arrange it so?"</p>

<p>But the girl persisted that she could not alter;
and so Agnes had had reluctantly to make up her
mind to a fresh responsibility, and determined to
consult her Aunt Phyllis on the subject.</p>

<p>And while her mind was perturbed with the
annoyance of having to install another servant in
her mother's absence, came another small trouble.</p>

<p>Alice sauntered into the room with a book in
her hand, and sat down on the hearthrug close to
the fire.</p>

<p>"Alice dear," said Agnes looking up, "have you
cleaned the bird's cage? It is the day for fresh
sand."</p>

<p>"I did it yesterday," answered Alice absently,
bending over her book.</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Agnes, "in fact I am
sure of it; because, don't you remember, we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[ 154]</a></span>
went out with Aunt Phyllis the moment after
breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Then it was the day before."</p>

<p>"So it may have been; but mother likes new
sand put every other day, without fail."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it presently," said Alice, a little
frown just settling itself on her brows.</p>

<p>Agnes made no further remark, though she felt
ruffled, and was sure Alice would forget after all.</p>

<p>Then John came in. "Agnes, Hugh and I want
a fire in our room. As it's the last day of the
holidays, we are going to have our long-deferred
turn-out."</p>

<p>"Very well; but, John, don't you toss everything
out on the landing for me to clear up."</p>

<p>"Is it likely?" asked he, surprised.</p>

<p>Agnes did not feel as if she could look up
brightly in answer, so she turned to her desk and
began to search for something.</p>

<p>"Lost something?" asked John, bending down
and looking in her face.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered, detecting a
significance in his kindly tone.</p>

<p>He kissed her and went off, and then Hugh
walked in.</p>

<p>"Agnes, I want to know if you could find John
and me a curtain to stretch across our large room?"</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"To divide it. John likes a place to himself;
we want to make it into two rooms. It has two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[ 155]</a></span>
windows, and so we are going to make ourselves
cosy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hugh, I do not know of any curtain; I
really think it will have to wait till mother comes."</p>

<p>"But we wanted to do it to-day. Don't you
think you know of anything?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not an old table-cloth, or a couple of done-with
window curtains?"</p>

<p>"I do not know in the least, and I should not
like to search in mother's stores."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"She might. Oh, Hugh dear, it must wait."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Hugh, looking disappointed.</p>

<p>"Did John tell you to ask?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly; he said he wished you could,
but he was afraid it was too much bother."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't manage it," she answered
regretfully.</p>

<p>All this time Alice's eyes had been raised from
her book, as she was interested in the discussion,
but as Hugh was turning to leave the room she
took up her book again.</p>

<p>"I should think Alice would be glad to begin
lessons," he observed, stopping short with his hand
on the door.</p>

<p>There was a mischievous look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall not," answered Alice.</p>

<p>"When are you to begin?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[ 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," answered Agnes.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" echoed Alice; "I thought we
should have holiday till they came back."</p>

<p>"What, nearly two months more to roast over
the fire and read novels!" laughed Hugh.</p>

<p>"I don't read novels."</p>

<p>"Stories then."</p>

<p>"And I don't roast over the fire."</p>

<p>"What do you call this?" he asked, advancing
to her and passing his hand down her shoulder.
"My eye, Alice, you are next door to on fire!"</p>

<p>"I'm not! I wish you wouldn't come bothering.
Hugh."</p>

<p>Having lodged his bombshell he departed,
leaving Alice writhing under the certainty that now
"beginning lessons" was put into Agnes's head
nothing would get it out again.</p>

<p>"I am going in to Aunt Phyllis," said her sister,
getting up and putting away her desk.</p>

<p>"I shall come too then," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Do not come just yet, dear, I want to talk to
auntie."</p>

<p>"You're always talking to auntie, I think,"
grumbled Alice.</p>

<p>"<i>Always?</i>" asked Agnes, feeling as if that were
the last worry, and she could not bear more.</p>

<p>"Well, not always; but, Agnes, I hope you will
not let her persuade you to begin school with
Minnie and me to-morrow because&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[ 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?" asked Agnes.</p>


<p>"I don't know exactly why, but it's horrid if
you do, because I haven't had half enough time;
and I never <i>thought</i> we should begin when the boys
did."</p>

<p>"I never thought anything else," answered Agnes;
and then she had gone in next door with a sense
of utter failure.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>And so Aunt Phyllis was right when she advised
her to raise her eyes heavenward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3><i>A SURPRISE.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i156b.png"
width="52" height="111" alt="I" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap"> say,
John, 'this 'ere' is rather tiring; and
when we've done there will be nothing
to show for it."</p>

<p>"Only our possessions will be in order,
and we shall start straight for the next
term."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Look at my possessions,
and see if you call that 'straight'?"</p>

<p>John picked his way over the drawers and
boxes scattered everywhere, and surveyed his
brother's treasures. There they were, lying in a
heap&mdash;clothes, collars, neckties, papers, nails, string,
knives, corks, ships, balls, fishing tackle, all mixed
up pell-mell.</p>

<p>"Is that your idea of tidying?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; put 'em all together, and then you know
what you have to do, and can act accordingly."</p>

<p>"I should think so! Act! all I can say is, I'd
rather it was you than me."</p>

<p>"How do you do it then?" asked Hugh hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159]</a></span>lessly,
watching his brother step back to his own
precincts.</p>

<p>"I take out one thing after another, and put
those I want on the bed&mdash;so, and tear up and burn
what I don't want."</p>

<p>"And a nice smell you make!" said Hugh,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Eh? oh, well, that's what a fire's for, to air
the room."</p>

<p>"With a vengeance. I wish Agnes could have
found us a large rag of some sort."</p>

<p>"You'd have been for ever playing pranks behind
it, and peeping through the holes of your 'rag;'
I'm not sorry on the whole she could not."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have. However, that's neither
here nor there. I'm going up to the attics to find
my hammer; I believe Agnes has put it away
tidily."</p>

<p>He went off, and presently John heard him
shouting for him to come up.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he called in answer.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"A find; a grand idea."</p>

<p>John went up, expecting a hoax, but yet
reassured by the earnestness of Hugh's tone.</p>

<p>"Look here," exclaimed a voice from the depths
of a small attic where only a few boxes were kept,
"if you don't think I've lighted on a splendid
plan. Here's a room for you all ready, and we've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160]</a></span>
nothing to do but carry up the bed, and there you
are."</p>

<p>By this time John stood in the low doorway of
the little room, and looked round.</p>

<p>His mind quickly placed a little furniture round
it, and hung his pictures and text on its bare walls,
and in a few moments it became his own little
room, full of his own things.</p>

<p>"Or I could have it," broke in Hugh's voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered John hastily, "I should like
it very much. But what will Agnes say?"</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> won't mind so long as we do no mischief.
Let's surprise her."</p>

<p>John looked dubious.</p>

<p>"It can't be any harm," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"I'll just go and tell her," answered John.</p>

<p>He ran down. "Where's Agnes?" he asked of
Alice, who was still reading.</p>

<p>"In next door," said Alice, "at least she was,
but I believe I saw her go along with grandmama
just now."</p>

<p>"When will she be home?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I say, Alice, you'll make yourself ill so near
the fire. Where's Minnie?"</p>

<p>"She went in after Agnes."</p>

<p>John withdrew, and returned to Hugh.</p>

<p>"She's out, Hugh," he said.</p>

<p>"That's all right then. We'll have a jolly time,
and get it done to surprise her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what about your grand heap?"</p>

<p>"Stuff them in again; they can't be worse than
they were."</p>

<p>"I wonder if we ought to sort them out first?"
said John, considering.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to; that would be no fun at all."</p>

<p>John yielded for a moment, then he paused.</p>

<p>"Hugh, Agnes would be right down vexed with
us, and we should deserve it. I won't do a stroke
till we've cleared this."</p>

<p>Hugh made a face; but when John's voice took
<i>that</i> tone it was of no use objecting, so they sorted
out and put up as quickly as they could, Hugh
privately shirking any idea of thoroughness, till
about twelve o'clock order once more reigned, and
the boys' spirits began to rise.</p>

<p>"I say," remarked John, surveying his new
domain, "I wish I'd asked Jane to clean this while
we were putting up, it looks mighty dusty and
queer."</p>

<p>"Well, we can't now," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"No, I daresay it would take ages."</p>

<p>"I can sweep it," said Hugh; "but that would be
a hindrance; let's get in the things and they'll
cover up the dirt."</p>

<p>"Nice that!" remarked John; "but as it is not
<i>your</i> room it won't matter."</p>

<p>"No," assented Hugh; "and if it were, I should
not care particularly. Now, John, what is the first
thing to do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bring up the chest of drawers."</p>

<p>"That's my chest of drawers. You don't mean
to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what am I to do?" said John, pausing
in this first difficulty; "you can't suppose I can go
without a chest of drawers."</p>

<p>"No; I don't see that you can; but, then, no
more can I."</p>

<p>"That's unanswerable; but as there's only one,
what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can have it," answered Hugh slyly; "it belongs
to my room!"</p>

<p>As his brother did not immediately reply, Hugh
saw he had gained an advantage.</p>

<p>"Here's a go," said John, looking round in
dismay. "Now I shouldn't wonder if you didn't
claim the washstand too."</p>

<p>"Then I <i>will</i> claim it," said Hugh with a
wink.</p>

<p>And sure enough Hugh kept the washstand.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got my own bed," said John; "you
can't take that from under me."</p>

<p>Decidedly with lowered spirits he descended to
see about the bedstead, unforeseen difficulties in the
direction of Agnes looming before him; but the
delight of planning how it was to go through the
door whole, turned off his thoughts.</p>

<p>At last the actual moment arrived. The clothes
and mattresses were heaped on Hugh's bed, and
they began wheeling it about in fine style.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163]</a></span></p>

<p>It was just too wide to go through the door, but
the boys did not take long to turn it on its side.
They had succeeded in almost clearing the back
and tallest end, when the banisters proved an
insuperable barrier to further progress.</p>

<p>"We must take it down," said John.</p>

<p>"I'm stuck. I say, John, did you ever happen to
mistake your fingers for the painted legs?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. Look, what a precious
mark you've made on the door that side."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"There! just where you say your fingers grazed
it."</p>

<p>"It'll come off," said Hugh, applying his pocket-handkerchief,
having first conveyed it to his tongue;
but it didn't, and Hugh shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Lesson No. 1. Don't knock your fingers," he
said.</p>

<p>"Lesson No. 2," remarked John. "Do you know
how to take down these precious things?"</p>

<p>"Lesson No. 3. Shall learn."</p>

<p>"Then do go up and get us a screw-driver; if
this comes to grief I shall tell Agnes it was all you."</p>

<p>"You seem afraid of Agnes," laughed Hugh.</p>

<p>"Not at all. But you know we are 'on the
spree;' and I don't want to do what she would
not like, which would be no spree."</p>

<p>The screw-driver was found, and then they began
in earnest; but before long the bumps and scrapes
brought Jane up from below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, master John, are you gone mad?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you say a syllable, Jane, or I'll skin
you," said Hugh coaxingly; "it would spoil all
our fun."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll call you up to see when we've done; but
do leave us now, there's a good soul."</p>

<p>She went down again, looking rather scared;
but the cook happened to be busy, and did not
notice it.</p>

<p>The bedstead now lay at their feet in pieces,
which they quickly carried upstairs, and by-and-by
were able to set up to their great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well, I call that prime," said Hugh; "now for
the clothes and things."</p>

<p>These were soon on; and the room began to look
"like a room," as John said.</p>

<p>"Might that window be grey ground glass, or
might it be dirt?" asked Hugh, going up to
examine it, and drawing his finger down it.</p>

<p>The question did not need answering, for he left
a line of clear glass behind him.</p>

<p>"Wait till I've got the rest of my furniture up,
and then I'll see to things," said John.</p>

<p>"The rest of it?" laughed Hugh. "I think this
is all of it; the rest belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Hugh, you're a cheat! Do you mean to say
I'm not to have a chair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll spare you a chair!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that little table's my <i>own</i>; so now, Mr.
Hugh!"</p>

<p>"So it is; what a bore! Why I was perfectly
counting on that table when your things were gone
off it."</p>

<p>"Very likely; you're sold there! But what shall
I do to wash on? I dare say Agnes has got a basin
somewhere."</p>

<p>"There's an odd set in here!" exclaimed Hugh,
springing up and hurrying into the box room next
door.</p>

<p>John followed quickly enough, and to his joy
found an old mahogany stand which would do very
well for the crockery which he discovered on a
top shelf covered with dust.</p>

<p>"How shall we wash it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll get our towels; Agnes'll <i>have</i> to give us
clean ones."</p>

<p>They pulled about the boxes and things till they
had secured their prize, and then went back in
triumph to John's "castle."</p>

<p>"Hugh, I shall never have you in here," said
John.</p>

<p>"Grateful," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"I mean, without asking."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not! Nor I you."</p>

<p>"I must come in when I want my things out of
my drawer," said John ruefully.</p>

<p>"What a pity we can't find a chest to match
that jimcrack in the corner!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's go and see."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done, and sure enough
there was a set, but on looking every drawer
was full.</p>

<p>The boys were now so thoroughly in the spirit
of the thing that they forgot all caution, and after
a rapid glance to see where they could stow the
things, out they bundled them heap on heap, till
the drawers were empty, then they paused and
looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I say, Hugh, we are in for it now; I don't
believe we ought to have done this."</p>

<p>"It can't be helped now; we must eat humble
pie."</p>

<p>"Look here, I won't do a thing more of this
sort. Here's a precious mess for that poor Agnes,
and I scouted the idea of giving her any trouble."</p>

<p>"She'll be home soon, if she isn't now."</p>

<p>"Then let's make haste. Fetch up my things.
Hugh, will you?"</p>

<p>Hugh ran down and soon brought up a drawer
full, and hastened off for another. For the girls
to see it before it was accomplished and in order,
would spoil everything.</p>

<p>"Now for the window," exclaimed John; "and
my pictures. I say, there's no carpet."</p>

<p>"Do without."</p>

<p>"I shall have to."</p>

<p>"There's lots in there," nodding towards the
box-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not I," answered John. "I'm not fond of
this sort of thing, Hugh; I wish I'd waited."</p>

<p>"Well, make the best of it now," said Hugh;
"we have done no <i>harm</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said John.</p>

<p>John was hard at work on the window, making
his towel in a worse mess than it was before, when
an exclamation from Hugh made him turn round.</p>

<p>"They're coming up," he called excitedly. "All
three of 'em. I can hear their voices."</p>

<p>For Jane had said, in answer to Agnes's enquiry
as to where her brothers were:</p>

<p>"Right at the top, I believe, miss."</p>

<p>So up they came, and all Hugh's "humble pie"
was demolished before he had time to produce it.</p>

<p>"John! Hugh! whatever <i>are</i> you after? Are
you gone out of your wits?"</p>

<p>"Come and look, Agnes," said John, hurrying to
her, "and don't be vexed, there's a darling. I
wanted a room to myself, and we meant to surprise
you; but when we'd got half through it I began
to fear you would be more than surprised."</p>

<p>An hour or two ago Agnes would have been
vexed, almost angry; now she had been to the
Fountain of Strength, and coming refreshed from
Him she answered gently:</p>

<p>"I can't say that I would rather you had done
it, but I'll try to like it if you wish."</p>

<p>She kissed their hot, dusty faces and looked
round.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you point out anything wrong I'll say
'Hugh did it,'" smiled John, "and he is to say
'John did it' if he is blamed."</p>

<p>"I see," answered Agnes.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a nice little room?"</p>

<p>"Very. I wonder mother never thought of it
before."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Hugh. "Now, Agnes,
you'll not mend that; it's as good as a whole
volume of permission. Let's go down to dinner
after that."</p>

<p>But as they went down John said to her:</p>

<p>"You're not really vexed, dear girl?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," she answered, looking up brightly.
"If you are pleased, I'm sure mother will not
mind till she has time to think about it. But.
John, the dirt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll come all right," said John.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3><i>THE MAGIC OF LOVE.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i169b.png"
width="51" height="108" alt="T" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">he
next morning everything was bustle
till the boys were off; for imperceptibly
they had got a little later during holiday
time, and on this first day of school they
discovered it, in finding no breakfast ready
when they came down.</p>

<p>But by dint of a little hurrying, and a decidedly
short meal for the boys, they really did start in
time.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you girls," said John gratefully, as
he caught up his books and ran off. "My last
term at school, Agnes!"</p>

<p>"Now here we are once more," said Agnes with
a deep sigh, gazing round on the room, which looked
ever so much more empty than if her brothers had
just started for an ordinary walk.</p>

<p>"Now I suppose <i>we</i> have to begin school?" said
Alice with a wry face. But the wry face was put
on, and the frown was gone&mdash;gone from her heart
too; for yesterday she had looked once more at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170]</a></span>
text on the wall, and had yielded herself again to
its influence.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," answered Agnes, "that we
would give ourselves a holiday to do John's room."</p>

<p>"Jolly!" exclaimed Minnie. "I can clean and
scrub beautifully; Jane says I can."</p>

<p>"We must all help to surprise him, for they will
be home at one, and we have plenty of work before
us."</p>

<p>"What shall we begin on?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I have to do a very quick piece of business,
which if you like you may come up to the top to
superintend; and then, Alice, I want you to go
round to the picture-frame shop in Southampton
Street, and tell the man I will send for it at eleven
o'clock."</p>

<p>She ran upstairs without explaining further,
followed by the wondering girls; and then they
saw her take down John's cardboard text very
carefully, and wrap it in paper.</p>

<p>"Now, Alice, as fast as you like there and back;
and Minnie must go with you."</p>

<p>"But you will do ever so much before we come,"
said Alice, looking disappointed.</p>

<p>"No; I am going down to see about the
dinner, and if you are not long will wait till you
return."</p>

<p>"But will the man understand what is to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I went about it yesterday, and I told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171]</a></span>
it was a secret, and so he would have to do it
expeditiously."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, come along Minnie, the sooner we
are off the sooner we shall be home."</p>

<p>In half an hour's time they were back, and met
Agnes coming up from her confabulations with the
cook.</p>

<p>"Just in time," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Should you have begun without us?" asked
Minnie.</p>

<p>"Not till ten."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Now then, Agnes, what are
we to do?"</p>

<p>"Go down and ask Jane for some cloths, and
brooms, and a tin basin."</p>

<p>Minnie opened her eyes, but Alice ran off.</p>

<p>They met Jane on the stairs with a pail and
scrubbing-brush. "Are you going to help us?"
asked Alice; and Jane nodded with a smile.</p>

<p>Up they all went, and found a bright little fire
burning in the already clean grate of John's little
attic.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Alice; "whoever thought of
that? What's it for?"</p>

<p>"What are fires generally for?" asked Agnes.</p>

<p>"To warm people," said Minnie.</p>

<p>"And don't you think we should feel it rather
cold to be up here for three hours, straight off, this
bitter day?"</p>

<p>"So we should. Well, Agnes, what first?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jane is to properly clean that smeary window;
and we will wash the chest of drawers and the
washstand and the crockery while she is doing it."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"To get off the dirt," laughed Agnes.</p>

<p>"I can't think why things get dirty!"</p>

<p>"It's London smoke," remarked Alice sententiously.</p>

<p>"And dust," said Agnes. While she spoke she
handed two aprons to her sisters, and a clean
piece of flannel each; and before they could ask
any more questions she had lifted out the drawers,
one by one, and was sweeping the ledges inside.
Then she began washing and rubbing and drying in
fine style, the little girls imitating her example as
fast as they could.</p>

<p>But Jane's window was done before their furniture,
and she immediately began to clean the paint
round the room.</p>

<p>"This paper looks dirty, miss. I wish you would
let me rub it with some bread."</p>

<p>"I do not mind," answered Agnes, looking up
from under the washstand, "if you think it will
look better."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will, miss."</p>

<p>"I'll run for the bread," exclaimed Minnie,
starting up.</p>

<p>"Mind you say a stale loaf, miss; and a knife!"
called Jane, turning round, to see only the tip of
one of Minnie's curls flying down the stairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all was sober work for another half-hour,
and after that came a pause.</p>

<p>"This floor looks black; it wants doing, I think,"
remarked Minnie.</p>

<p>Jane laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it does, Jane?" said Minnie
soberly. "Look there, and there; but it's all over."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Jane.</p>

<p>"Then do you mean to do it?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>For answer Jane went down on her knees and
began to scrub, while Agnes led the way into the
box-room, the children following to see what she
was going to do.</p>

<p>She drew out the roll of carpet which Hugh had
fixed his eyes on the day before, and they carried
it to the landing and spread it open under the
skylight.</p>

<p>Agnes selected what she wanted for her purpose,
and told Alice to roll the other up again. Then she
produced from her pocket a skein of thread and
two large needles, and handing one to Alice, she
proceeded to thread her own.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Sew up that bit of seam that is ripped."</p>

<p>Alice sat down on the ground, and after some
difficulty succeeded in reducing a rent of a quarter
of a yard to a pretty respectable seam.</p>

<p>"Well done!" said Agnes. "Now let us have
another look. Oh, yes, there is a place torn! and
while I do it will you two go round again for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174]</a></span>
frame? The room will be dry, and we can do the
final touches all together."</p>

<p>There could be no objection to this, and the
children hastened away just as Jane came out with
her pail and brushes. "It's all done, miss," she
said.</p>

<p>"Then, when they return, will you come up
again, Jane? I shall not want you till then."</p>

<p>They all ran down, and left Agnes alone. She
finished the carpet, and then went into the box-room
and looked round.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master John," she said, half aloud, "of
course you were not going to give me anything to
do; but just look here! However," she added,
smiling to herself, "perhaps <i>this</i> was Hugh!"</p>

<p>So patiently she set herself to make the best of
it. She folded, and sorted, and pinned up in
bundles, and had nearly finished tidying the great
heap, when the children came hurrying back,
bearing in their arms a nice Oxford frame, through
the glass of which shone out what was to be John's
life-text, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes," said Minnie, "did you buy it with
your very own money?"</p>

<p>"Don't you like it?" answered Agnes.</p>

<p>"I wish <i>I</i> had one," said Alice wistfully.</p>

<p>"If you will paint one for yourself I'll have it
framed," promised Agnes.</p>

<p>Then up came Jane, and once more they set to
work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Agnes found a piece of red valance for the top
of the window, and got out two clean toilet-covers,
and they laid the carpet down, hung the frame on
the wall, and Alice dusted the mantelshelf. Then
they paused and looked round.</p>

<p>"It is lovely!" said Minnie. "I wish it were
<i>my</i> room."</p>

<p>"So does everybody," said Alice. "Is it really
finished, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Now as we still have half-an-hour,
let us go and see what can be done for poor old
Hugh. His room looks rather forlorn as it is."</p>

<p>"So it does," said Minnie; "and the place where
John's bed stood is all bare."</p>

<p>"He wants a table <i>dreadfully</i>," said Alice,
"now John's is gone."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't one for him; but we will go
and have a look, while Jane sweeps a little; perhaps
we may find something which will serve for
one."</p>

<p>They went back into the box-room. "Here is
a little round table with one leg off," announced
Alice, from the depths of a corner.</p>

<p>"Is the leg there?"</p>

<p>"I can't see it."</p>

<p>"Then it's of no use."</p>

<p>"My eyes are sharp," exclaimed Minnie, jumping
over the boxes and bundles and sliding down somewhere
near Alice.</p>

<p>"How you startled me!" said Alice; "but how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176]</a></span>ever
sharp your eyes are, Miss Minnie, you won't
find it here."</p>

<p>But she did for all that. She went to work
carefully, poking about with her little hands without
disturbing anything, and when the others had given
it up as hopeless, a joyful cry from her announced
its discovery.</p>

<p>They were just fitting it into its place and considering
whether Hugh would be able to mend it,
when the two boys came rushing up the stairs from
school.</p>

<p>"I'm moved up!" exclaimed Hugh, long before
he got in sight of his sisters. "Whatever are you
girls doing up here? Isn't that jolly for me?"</p>

<p>They congratulated him on this joyful piece of
school news, and then Agnes, who had been holding
the handle of John's door in her hand all this time,
said solemnly:</p>

<p>"John, the dirt in your room has disappeared by
magic!"</p>

<p>"<i>How?</i>" asked John.</p>

<p>"By magic&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>She flung the door open, and the boys crowded
in.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed John, "words fail me!" Then
he paused as his eyes fell upon his text in its new
setting.</p>

<p>"Agnes!"</p>

<p>"That's with my best love," answered Agnes,
blushing. "It is worth framing."</p>

so the time slipped away. Alice and
Minnie found that when once they made
up their minds to regular lessons with
their sister they began to take an interest
in them, and were really happier than
they would have been to be idle.</p>

<p>Soon after they began one morning, aunt Phyllis's
sweet face peeped in at the door.</p>

<p>"Any admittance, my dears?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come in!" said Agnes, springing up to
welcome her.</p>

<p>"I have thought of something which I am
burning to propose to you," said Miss Headley,
coming round to kiss each in turn.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Minnie, laying down her
pen and pushing back her curls.</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis did not answer till she had seated
herself by the fire, then she said:</p>

<p>"You go out for your 'constitutional' directly
after your early dinner, do you not, dears?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, "and I wish we didn't."</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis shook her head. "It is quite
right, I have not come in to alter that, little puss."</p>

<p>Alice pouted just a very little, and Miss Headley
went on:</p>

<p>"You come home about three, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Half past," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"What do you do then?"</p>

<p>"We work, or learn lessons, or gape, or are idle,"
said Alice, smiling a little.</p>

<p>Aunt Phyllis smiled too. "How should you
like to bring your work in with me? I have an
interesting book I want to read to you, and if
Agnes is busy, or tired, she can stay at home, and
I'll see to your work. Eh, Alice and Minnie?"</p>

<p>"Lovely!" answered Minnie.</p>

<p>"Awfully nice!" answered Alice.</p>

<p>And Agnes murmured thanks with a sigh of
relief, for that hour in the day had been one of her
trials.</p>

<p>"What work have you in hand?" asked their
aunt.</p>

<p>"Minnie is making a doll's dress, and I have just
finished some horrid white calico."</p>

<p>"It must be real, sensible work," said Miss
Headley. "How about stockings?"</p>

<p>"Agnes mends those," answered Minnie; "it
nearly made her cry to teach Alice, and she gave
it up; and I haven't begun to learn."</p>

<p>Agnes looked rather ashamed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, auntie," she explained, "I know I got out
of patience, but I would ten times rather do it
myself than make Alice."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I was very nice over it," said
Alice in a low tone; "but it is nasty work!"</p>

<p>"Very," answered aunt Phyllis, so sympathizingly
that Alice looked up amazed. "But only because
you do not know how to do it. We will get over
that in a little while. So both of you come in this
afternoon with all the stockings you can find, and
we will begin in good earnest."</p>

<p>"All?" said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Yes; then I can take my choice. I shall not
give you bad ones to do first, they are too difficult
for beginners."</p>

<p>"You are too kind, auntie," said Agnes, getting
up to kiss her gratefully; then adding, "Didn't I
tell you I was good for nothing? Haven't even
patience to help Alice mend stockings!"</p>

<p>"You are not going to the looking-glass again,
my child?" she whispered, smiling.</p>

<p>Agnes smiled too, though she was crying quietly.
She knelt down and poked the fire, and got rid of
her tears somehow before anyone but her aunt
guessed about them, and then she turned round to
the table.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am hindering," said aunt Phyllis,
getting up; "but I am like a child when I have a
piece of news&mdash;I must tell it."</p>

<p>So she went, and the girls settled down again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[ 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> aunt Phyllis like a child?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"I think she is," answered Agnes; "her heart
always seems fresh and young."</p>

<p>"I wonder why?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"She reminds me of those words," answered
Agnes, 'Like a tree planted by the rivers of
waters.'"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Her soul is always drawing nourishment from
Jesus; that's how it is. Like the roots of the
tree by the rivers of waters."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Minnie, looking up, "I never thought
of that before!"</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you doing?" exclaimed John, coming
into the dining-room after school that morning,
and bouncing down in a chair by his little sister's
side.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;&mdash;, but I shan't let you see, John," exclaimed
Minnie, covering her little pink hands over
her occupation.</p>

<p>Vainly, however; for she could not hide the
large sheet of newspaper over which she leaned,
nor the chips of red and blue paper which peeped
out in every direction.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> see," said John, "here's an end of a matchbox,
and here's a bit of yellow paper, and here's
a star of red, cutout pretty well, Miss Minnie, and
here's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John, you are too bad," said Minnie, laying her
head down as an extra protection. "I didn't want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181]</a></span>
you to see till it's done, and I should have put it
all away by one o'clock. I wish you had not come
home so early." Minnie spoke in a grumbling little tone, which
made John inclined to tease her more than ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i181.png" width="400" height="600" alt="" title="" /><br />
<p class="cen">"'John, you are too bad,' said Minnie, laying
her head down as an extra protection."</p>
<p class="ralign"><i>p. 180.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So he laid hold of one of the long golden curls
which fell over the treasures, and went on while
he twisted it round his fingers&mdash;</p>

<p>"And here's a pair of scissors, and here's the
inside of the matchbox, and here's&mdash;why, here
are at least a dozen babies!"</p>

<p>What with her hair being touched, which she
particularly disliked, and what with her secret
being found out, as she thought, Minnie burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Hey-day!" said John. "Why, Minnie, you
goose, I wasn't really meaning to tease you. Look
here, I'll sit still here for as long as you like, and
shut my eyes up as close as a mole (if they do),
while you put all that precious rubbish away; and
what's more, I won't tell a soul about it; no, not
if I&mdash;suffer for it."</p>

<p>Minnie looked up through her tears to see if
John were in earnest, and found him sitting, as he
said, with his eyes shut and his hands folded in
front of him in a comical manner.</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh, and raised her head;
but added, with the remains of a sob, "You're a
<i>dreadful</i> tease, John, and I did want nobody to
know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody to know," echoed John, in a mock
tone; "is that a pun?"</p>

<p>"You know it isn't; I don't try to make puns."</p>

<p>"Have you put away yet, Miss Dignity?"</p>

<p>"Nearly. Now, John, <i>have</i> you guessed&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Know everything," answered John, "just as
well as I knew when I entered the room."</p>

<p>"How much is that?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"Everything," answered the boy. "Come, Minnie,
my eyes ache with keeping shut so tight."</p>

<p>Minnie found it would be better to hurry her
preparations than to answer the brother, who was
for ever getting the best of her; so in a minute all
was away, and John, with a sigh of profound relief,
looked up.</p>

<p>Minnie left the room, and John walked to the
comfortable fire and whistled.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before a little step
was heard on the stairs, and Minnie appeared again.</p>

<p>She was walking more slowly than usual, and
her head was bent down, while her curls failed to
hide the deep flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"John," she said slowly, "I am sorry I was
cross about those boxes; I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"I don't care to know, Minnie," said John,
looking down on her; "it was only to tease you a
little bit, but I didn't think you would really
mind."</p>

<p>Minnie leaned her head against her brother's
arm caressingly, and answered softly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I oughtn't to have minded; especially&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Especially what?" asked John kindly, guessing
by his little sister's manner that she was very
much in earnest.</p>

<p>"I was trying to do something for Him, you
know, John, and it seemed so horrid of me to be
vexed and cross over that."</p>

<p>"I understand," said John.</p>

<p>"I was making&mdash;but I will show you all about
it."</p>

<p>Minnie went to the cupboard, and drew out the
odds and ends which had attracted John's attention.</p>

<p>"See here," she said, spreading them out on the
table, "I have been collecting all the matchboxes
for months, and now I have bought these two
dozen little china dolls, and Agnes gave me some
white wadding; and I am going to cover the
boxes with this paper, and put little ornaments at
the bottom and top&mdash;so; and then&mdash;but here is
one quite finished."</p>

<p>Minnie opened a bright little box, and there
inside, on a bed of whitest, softest wool, a little
china doll reposed, clothed in a wrapper of pink
silk; under her head a little roll of wadding served
as a pillow.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look cosy?" asked Minnie, patting
her complacently.</p>

<p>"And what's it for? How can it be for the
Lord Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember how we mended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184]</a></span>
those toys before Christmas, and sent them to the
children's ward of the hospital?"</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>"So that's just what I'm going to do now; here
will be two dozen little presents, and it will make
two dozen little children happy for a whole day, I
shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"It is a very good thought," said John.</p>

<p>"And that's why I was sorry I'd been cross
over <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John thoughtfully; "but I
believe, Minnie, if we were more anxious to please
Him, we should be far more careful than we are
about <i>everything</i>. All that we do is really working
for Him, and I do believe&mdash;I'm saying it to
myself, and not to you, Minnie&mdash;that if we watched
more, and realized His loving presence more, we
should live very differently from what we do."</p>

<p>Minnie slowly shut up her boxes, and when
John had finished speaking she said softly, "We
must try more than ever."</p>

<p>"And get Him to help us more than ever,"
added John.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3><i>THE END OF THE JOURNEY.</i></h3>

<img src="images/i187b.png"
width="56" height="112" alt="Y" class="firstletter" /><p class="dropcap">es,
they came home.</p>

<p>The three months did pass away at
length, and the last part of it flew much
quicker than the beginning.</p>

<p>"We shall arrive, 'God willing,' about
the end of March, as we sail by the
<i>Sardinia</i> on the 15th; but you will get a telegram
from Liverpool when we land," wrote their father.</p>

<p>John could understand that "God willing" better
now than he did when they went away; for he had
taken that "will of God" as the one object of his
life.</p>

<p>It might be&mdash;it would be&mdash;with many failures,
but "What wilt Thou?" was now his one question,
and to do it his one desire.</p>

<p>Of strong character, with a will which was difficult
to curb, he found it an inexpressible comfort
to yield to One who was so strong, that there could
not be a question of His power; and when once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186]</a></span>
the great surrender had been made, he walked
along holding the guiding hand with tender love
and reverence.</p>

<p>One morning, just as Agnes and her sisters were
sitting down to lessons, a telegram was brought in
by the new maid, whom Agnes had found and installed
more than a month before.</p>

<p>"We are in Liverpool, and hope to reach you
about five o'clock," it said.</p>

<p>Minnie and Alice got up and jumped round the
room as the only suitable expression of their feelings;
and as for Agnes, her thankfulness was quiet,
but too deep for words.</p>

<p>"May I rush in and tell grandmamma?" exclaimed
Alice, when her wild capers had come at
last to a stop.</p>

<p>When she saw that Agnes gave permission, she
snatched up the telegram and was off in an
instant.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she'll wait for her hat and
jacket," said Minnie, acting policeman.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will! They are hanging in the
hall."</p>

<p>Minnie peeped out of window, and in another
moment Alice, dressed in some style, emerged
from the door, ran down the steps, and was admitted
to the next house.</p>

<p>"Must I go on with school?" asked Minnie
rather forlornly.</p>

<p>"No; to-day is too good a day for it not to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187]</a></span>
holiday. Clear up the books, Minnie, and surprise
Alice."</p>

<p>Minnie did not need twice telling; and then she
and Agnes went upstairs to prepare their parents'
room, to see that the new Jane made a nice fire,
and that everything was well aired and ready.</p>

<p>While they were busy Alice came back from
next door with a long, heavy roll in her arms.</p>

<p>"The hearthrug?" questioned Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes. We are not to lay it down till everything
is done and the room perfectly ready. Oh, it <i>is</i> a
beauty! I never saw such a pretty rug."</p>

<p>Then at one o'clock the boys came home, and
great were the laments that the travellers might
arrive before they returned from afternoon school;
but this had to be endured, and, as Alice suggested.
"Perhaps, after all, they <i>wouldn't</i>."</p>

<p>Nor did they. The boys closed up with greater
speed than they had ever done before, and raced
home. As they turned the corner of their street a
cab was rattling along in front of them, and, half-fearing
and half-hoping, they set off to outstrip it,
which they managed to do, and arrived too breathless
to speak, but with glowing, happy faces, in
time to open the cab door, just as a shout from
Minnie at the window announced the fact of the
arrival to those inside the house.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>"Father," said Hugh, when, late that night, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188]</a></span>
their parents had come back from visiting their
grandmother next door, they all sat together round
the fire, as if loth to part, "Father, would you
mind telling us all, now we are together, what you
said to me upstairs?"</p>

<p>His father gave a quick look at him; for upstairs
Hugh had told him all about that episode
with Tom on Christmas-day.</p>

<p>"Would you rather, dear boy?" asked his father.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was not brave once, but I'll try to be
brave now."</p>

<p>His mother held out one hand to him, the other
being clasped by Agnes, while Minnie sat at their
feet, leaning against them, though she disdained
the idea of being in the least sleepy.</p>

<p>John sat by his father, his eyes shining with a
serene light.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," said Mr. Headley, after a
moment, only pausing to draw Alice close to his
side, "what I said upstairs was this, I think.
Mother and I decided long ago for ourselves, that,
seeing the misery which drink brings to thousands in
our country, we will not, for our part, take one drop
of it except as medicine. We will do our best to
prove that men and women can live, and be happy
too, without it. If you read the fourteenth of
Romans, you will see all the arguments set down
which influenced us. Feeling that this is for us a
sacred duty, we have brought you up in the same
way, expecting you as a matter of obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189]</a></span>
abstain while you are young. By-and-by you will
be able to judge more wisely than you can now."</p>

<p>"Then explain to them where I was wrong,
father."</p>

<p>"You failed in obedience&mdash;and in courage," added
his father.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Hugh very gravely, "I saw
that very soon, but not as plainly as you have put
it, father."</p>

<p>"I have sometimes felt it a great comfort in the
perplexities which arise in our hearts and lives to
do as Paul says&mdash;'Take the shield of <i>faith</i> whereby
we may quench the fiery darts of the wicked one'&mdash;and
I believe it is applicable to you too, Hugh.</p>

<p>"When questions come up which I cannot
answer, I say to myself, 'I will take refuge under
my faith in my heavenly Father; if I hide under
<i>His</i> shadow, the fiery darts will have no power.
He has said so; He knows best.'</p>

<p>"So you, Hugh, take refuge under your faith in
your earthly father, say 'he knows best;' and
while you are young it will help you to find an
answer, when otherwise you might be tempted to
do what you would grieve in after years to have
done."</p>

<p>"But you don't think drinking a glass of beer
or wine wrong in itself, father?"</p>

<p>"Wrong for me, thinking as I do; wrong for
you, because of my convictions, and my commands
to you concerning them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh seemed entirely satisfied; for was he not
forgiven? And then they turned to other subjects,
though Alice's eyes were looking wonderingly at
them all.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said suddenly, as Mrs. Headley's
white shawl fell from her shoulders, "you have a
different dress on from any you had before you
went away, and it&mdash;&mdash;has <i>crpe</i> on it."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered her mother gently; "but my
heart is not in mourning."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;," said Alice, not liking to ask more.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Headley went on, "I had a lovely
two months with her; 'cheered her heart,' she said.
We had time to talk together of all the way we had
been led. I learned from her how faith in God
can triumph when outward circumstances are anything
but prosperous (for she had not let me know
all these years what a struggle she had had with
poverty); and then I was, through dear father's kindness,
able to arrange things a little better for her,
and to add several comforts to her lot. Directly I
got there, dear father let me buy an invalid chair
for her, and many things which eased her exceedingly,
and I prepared to leave her with the
prospect of her never being so straitened again;
for he allowed me to arrange for her to receive
that little money I have of my own, which added
to her small income would make a great difference.</p>

<p>"But the Lord knew best; and though He let
me do all this for my mother, that my heart might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191]</a></span>
be comforted, He took the care of her into His
own hands.</p>

<p>"Just a week before we sailed I was sitting with
her one evening when she said, as quietly as we are
talking now:</p>

<p>"'My dear, the Lord's been very good to give
you to me&mdash;long ago, and now. The journey is
almost over, but <i>He</i> is at the end.'</p>

<p>"I only clasped her hand in answer; for she
looked tired, and I thought she would sleep; and
so she did&mdash;but it was to wake to find herself at
the end of her journey, and with Him."</p>

<p>"Dear mother," said John, coming over to kiss
her, "why did you not tell us? We have been
too cheerful and noisy for you to-night."</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I would not have saddened
our return to you for anything. I am <i>not</i>
sad, children. If the dear Lord had asked me I
could not have chosen anything I should like
better. To have been with her for nearly two
months, and then to have watched her go home,
what could heart wish more?"</p>

<p>"Then is that why Agnes has been crying since
you came?" asked Minnie, turning round to look
up in her sister's tearful face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said her mother; "for Agnes guessed
at once, and it has come as sad news to her; but
she will rejoice in my joy soon."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you went," said Hugh, "even though&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even though what, dear?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"Even though I've had such a lot to learn while
you've been gone."</p>

<p>"So have I," said John humbly; and Mr.
Headley added:</p>

<p>"But the lessons learned in our Father's school
are golden lessons, and can never fade away."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
